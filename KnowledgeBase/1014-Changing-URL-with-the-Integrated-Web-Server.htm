    <title>Changing an Inedo Product's URL with the Integrated Web Server</title>
  </head>
  <body>

      <div class="attention">
        <p>If you installed an Inedo Product using <b>Inedo Hub</b>, you can change the URL in the <b>Configuration</b> tab of the Inedo Hub desktop application.</p>
      </div>

      <p>All Inedo products can run using an Integrated Web Server instead of IIS. While this offers a simpler configuration and installation, 
      the integrated web server lacks many of the advanced features of a full-fledged web application server, and certain configuration is far from obvious. 
      For example, this post will cover binding the integrated web server to a host name.</p>

      <h4>Host Names</h4>
        <p>
            Binding a web site to a host name is a familiar task to anyone that has administered a site. In IIS 7, 
            it’s usually accomplished with a configuration dialog similar to this one:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="screenshot" alt="IIS 7 Site Binding" src="http://inedo.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/image9.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Our product's integrated servers also allow you to bind to a host name, but in a less obvious manner.
        </p>

      <h4>Host Names with our Product's Web Servers</h4>
        <p>
            For BuildMaster and Otter follow the steps below. For ProGet the steps are actually the same, except ProGet uses a single service 
            for both web- and back-end processing, so there are fewer options. But the syntax is identical.
        </p>

      <p>
          Refer to this table - depending on which product you are using, enter the coinciding name, or abbreviation, into each
          space that has a red <span style="color: red">[product's name]</span> or <span style="color: red">[service]</span>.
      </p>
      <table style="width: 650px; margin: 30px 0px;">
          <tr>
              <td align="center">The Inedo Product You're Using</td>

        <p>
            <span style="color: red">[product's name]</span> uses the HTTP.SYS driver to manage HTTP requests, and this driver requires that bindings are reserved at a system-wide level. 
            The service provides a utility to help with this. 
        </p>

      <ol>
          <li>Shut down the <span style="color: red">[product's name]</span> web server service. </li>

          <li>Open an <strong>elevated</strong> command prompt on the <span style="color: red">[product's name]</span> server and navigate to the <span style="color: red">[product's name]</span> 
          Server directory (by default, this is C:\<span style="color: red">[product's name]</span>\Service) </li>

          <li>
              Run ><span style="color: red">[service]</span>.exe; this will open a text-based menu with options like this:

              <li><strong>Urls</strong> –&#160; enter the host name and port; <ul><i>for example</i>: http://buildmaster:80/ would bind to http://buildmaster as the host name at port 80.
