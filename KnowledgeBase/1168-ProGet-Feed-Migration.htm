    <h2>Migrating a Feed Between ProGet Instances</h2>
    <p>
        It may be necessary to migrate all of the packages you have stored in a ProGet feed from one instance to another.
        There's a few different ways to do this depending on the feed type, and this document will describe the various approaches.
    </p>

    <h3>Option 1: Migrate using Feed Replication</h3>
    <p>
        Supported feed types: <b>NuGet, Chocolatey, PowerShell, npm, Maven, PyPI, VSIX, Helm, Debian, Ruby Gems, Universal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the preferred method for migration, since it is easy to configure and works across all feed types. However, it requires
        a ProGet Enterprise license and requires either the source instance to be accessible to the target or the target instance
        to be accessible to the source over the network. If you do not have ProGet Enterprise or your instances are isolated, see another
        options below.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Configure a one-way sync relationship from the old instance to the new instance</li>
        <li>Wait for replication to complete</li>
        <li>Delete sync relationship</li>
        <li>Disable old feed</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Option 2: Migrate using Drop Path</h3>
    <p>
        Supported feed types: <b>NuGet, Chocolatey, PowerShell, npm, PyPI, VSIX, Helm, Debian, Ruby Gems, Universal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This method is simple, but requires packages to be manually copied to the target server, or to a network path accessible
        from the target server.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Locate package storage path from source feed by visiting the Admin->Manage Feed page</li>
        <li>Copy all packages from the storage path to a directory (see <a href="https://gist.github.com/inedo-builds/b788c15b20d6c948097da0de53af75c0">this PowerShell script</a> for an example)</li>
        <li>Configure the bulk import drop path of the target feed to point to the directory from step 2</li>
        <li>Wait for all packages to be imported</li>
        <li>Disable bulk import drop path for target feed</li>
        <li>Disable old feed</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Option 3: Direct Database and File System Import/Export</h3>
    <p>
        Supported feed types: <b>Maven</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This method is complicated and can technically be performed on any feed type with the right SQL scripts, but we only
        provide example scripts for migrating Maven feeds in this way, since Maven feeds don't currently support drop path imports.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Determine feed ID of source feed by visiting the Admin->Manage Feed page and looking at the ?feedId= part of the URL in the browser</li>
        <li>Locate package storage path from source feed by visiting the Admin->Manage Feed page</li>
        <li>Connect to the source instance's database using SSMS (for SQL Server) or pgAdmin (for PostgreSQL)</li>
        <li>Execute the export script against your ProGet database, substituting the feed ID determined in step 1: (<a href="https://gist.github.com/inedo-builds/3bfdf846fb78fdf5ecd03d736682679f">SQL Server</a> | <a href="https://gist.github.com/inedo-builds/54eb40bb847298df7ec6edca721666f3">PostgreSQL</a></li>
        <li>Save the XML output from step 3 into a file, and copy the file to the server hosting the target's database</li>
        <li>Create a new feed of the same type in the target instance</li>
        <li>Locate package storage path of target feed by visiting the Admin->Manage Feed page</li>
        <li>Copy all contents recursively from the path determined in step 2 to the path determined in step 7</li>
        <li>Connect to the target instance's database using SSMS and execute the <a href="https://gist.github.com/inedo-builds/80486de84fd413313d54eb80edb821bf">import script</a>, subsituting the target feed ID and input XML file name</li>
        <li>Disable old feed</li>
    </ol>
