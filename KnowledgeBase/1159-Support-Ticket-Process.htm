    <p>
        When you submit a ticket using the <a href="https://inedo.com/support/submit-ticket">ticket submission form</a>, it will automatically create an issue in <a href="https://inedo.myjetbrains.com/youtrack">Inedo’s YouTrack instance</a>, in a non-public project intended for support. While you won’t be able to see the status of your tickets using YouTrack, you can see the status or add comments on <a href="https://my.inedo.com/tickets">my.inedo.com/tickets</a>, or add comments by replying to emails that are dispatched to you.

        A ticket starts in a “Submitted” status. From there, after one of our support engineers assess it, we may move it to “Open”, which means we are actively working on addressing the issue, and it may take a little bit of time. This will dispatch an automatic email that looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>
        We will add a comment to the issue in YouTrack, which will dispatch another email to you, and we will put the ticket in either “Responded” or “Awaiting Response”. You can respond to this ticket (either via an email response, or a comment on my.inedo.com), in which case the ticket will return to an “In Progress” status.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the issue seems to be resolved, we may move the ticket to a “Closed” status. This will automatically dispatch an email like this:
    </p>
