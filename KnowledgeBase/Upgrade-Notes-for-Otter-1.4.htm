    <p><a href="/otter/1.4">Otter 1.4</a> is minor release with the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Agentless (PowerShell) Windows Communication (<span class="major">new feature</span>)</li>
        <li>Variable Enhancements</li>
        <li>OtterScript/Execution Engine Changes</li>
        <li>New API Endpoints</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upgrade Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Because most of the changes are additive, the upgrade risks are <b>minimal</b>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
    <p>Because both variables and the execution engine have been updated, there is a potential for unintentional changes/bugs to be introduced. To mitigate these risks: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are minor database schema changes, so make sure to <a href="/support/documentation/otter/administration/backing-up">back up your Otter instance</a> in order to do a rollback.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the installation's \Extensions directory is backed up prior to upgrade</li>
        <li>Test configuration and orchestration plans in earlier environments prior to working against production servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upgrade Process</h2>
    <p>
        Otter may be upgraded by simply running the latest installer. The agents do not need to be updated.
    </p>


    <h2>Rollback</h2>
    <p>
        Because there are database changes, a rollback will require uninstalling Otter, and then <a href="/support/documentation/otter/administration/backing-up">restoring your Otter instance</a>.
