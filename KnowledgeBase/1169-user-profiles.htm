      Regardless which of our products you use, you've probably utilized our <a href="/support/questions">QA forum</a> at some point. With our product offering expanding this year, we've seen more and more folks using the QA forum. Not only to seek responses from our support engineers, but also answering other users' questions, and providing advice around troubleshooting and best practices. Noticing the camaraderie and expanded usage of the forum, we've decided to add user profiles to create a more usable and sustainable platform for you, our users.
  </p>
  <h2>
      About User Profiles
  </h2>

  <p>
      User profiles can be thought of as an extension of our existing QA Forum. They not only allow users to maintain a history of QA posts, but also allow users to engage with one another, upload custom extensions, and <a href="/den/all-items#supported-by=community">browse items</a> created by other members of the Inedo community.
  </p>
  <h2>
      Creating your Profile
  </h2>
  <p>
      Making your profile is easy, and takes just a few steps.

  </p>
  <h3>
      Step 1
  </h3>
  <p>
      Select <em><strong>log in</strong></em> at the top right corner.
  </p>

  <img class="screenshot" src="/blog/_images/profile-login.png" />
  <p>
      You will then be redirected to <a href="https://my.inedo.com">my.inedo.com</a>. If you already have a MyInedo account, proceed to log in as normal. Otherwise, create a MyInedo account.
  </p>

  <h3>
      Step 2
  </h3>
  <p>
      Once you've created or logged into your account, you'll need to navigate back to inedo.com to continue creating your profile.
  </p>
  <p>
      Once on inedo.com, again, select <em><strong>log in</strong></em>. Once clicked, you'll notice the word <em><strong>Account</strong></em> appears in place of <em><strong>log in</strong></em>. Select <em><strong>Account</strong></em>.
  </p>
  <img class="screenshot" src="/blog/_images/account.png"/>
  <p>
      You'll be taken to the <em>Create Profile </em>page to create your public profile.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Step 3
  </h3>
  <p>
      Creating a profile has only two required fields: Email Address and Username.
  </p>
  <img class="screenshot" src="/blog/_images/required.png"/>
  <p>
      Your email address will be auto-populated based on your MyInedo account. These two required fields cannot be changed; however, if you switch jobs, or need to change them for any reason, <a href="/contact">contact us</a>, and we'll take care of it.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Step 4
  </h3>
  <p>
      Though not required, we recommend filling out the <em>Full Name</em> field, as this is what shows up at the top of your profile. This can be a first, last, or secondary username. It's worth noting that this will be visable to everyone when you post on the QA Forum.
  </p>
  <p>
      For further customization, we have some additional fields: summary, avatar, social media accounts, and contact preference. Fill in as much, or as little as you'd like, and select save.
