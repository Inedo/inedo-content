    <p><a href="/otter/2.1">Otter 2.1</a> is minor release with the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pipeline Raft Support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
    <p>
        There are no breaking changes in this release. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While there are no expected breaking changes, the context behavior of Orchestration Jobs has been specified
        as of v2.1 where previously it was undefined, and it is possible that executing plans with via orchestration job could 
        result in unexpected behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        See the <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/jobs#orchestration-job-context">Orchestration Job Context documentation</a>
        for the behavior specification.
    </p>

    <h2>New Features &amp; Non-Functional Changes</h2>
    <h3>Pipeline and Pipeline-Only Rafts</h3>
    <p>
        A new type of virtualized raft is now available to facilitate a promotion-based approach to infrastructure automation -
        A configuration plan and all of its resources can be kept in Git or the Otter database for a Dev/Testing environment, then
        promoted to higher environments (such as Production) using read-only zip file rafts.
    </p>

    <h2>Risk Mitigation</h2>
    <p>The only significant changes are additive. If you do not use the new pipeline rafts, then risk is minimal.</p>

    <h2>Upgrade Process</h2>
    <p>
        Otter may be upgraded by simply running the latest installer. The agents do not need to be updated.
    </p>

    <h2>Rollback</h2>
    <p>
        There are no database schema changes, so a rollback will only require uninstalling Otter, and then reinstalling the old version.
