    <p class="announcement">
        <b>Upgrading from a version older than 4.x?</b> It is strongly recommended that you first review <a href="/support/kb/1153/upgrading-from-proget-v2-and-v3">Upgrading from ProGet v2 and v3 </a>before proceeding.
    </p>
  <p><a href="/proget/4.4">ProGet 4.4</a> is minor release with the following changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Package Promotion Support for Universal, NuGet, PowerShell, Chocolatey, and npm Feeds</li>
    <li>Package Deployment Support for Universal, NuGet, PowerShell, and Chocolatey Feeds</li>
  </ul>  

  <h2>Upgrade Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The feed view/search pages and package version pages for all feed types have been combined, therefore some feed-specific UI functionality 
    may be missing or perform differently than in previous versions. <a href="/support/contact">Let us know</a> if you encounter any oddities 
    with these or other pages during your usage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than the UI, new functionality since v4.3 is additive and upgrade risks are negligable.
  </p>

  <h2>Upgrade Process</h2>
  <p>
    ProGet may be upgraded by simply running the latest installer.
  </p>

  <h2>Rollback</h2>
  <p>
    See <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/backing-up">restoring your ProGet instance</a> for how to rollback.
    Restoring a v4.3 version should not require a database restore since all database changes were additive.
