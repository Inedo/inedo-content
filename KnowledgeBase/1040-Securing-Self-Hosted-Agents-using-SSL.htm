    <title>Securing Self-Hosted Agents using SSL</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
		BuildMaster Agents exposed to the Internet should include additional security compared to agents running on a secure local network.
		The self-hosted agents in BuildMaster support the use of SSL encryption just like agents hosted using IIS.
	</p>

    <h2>Installing the Certificate</h2>
    <p>
        To use SSL, you must have an appropriate certificate installed to the machine store on the BuildMaster Agent. You can view/add
	    certificates using the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632619.aspx">Certificates MMC Snap-In</a>. Take note of
	    the <strong>Friendly Name</strong> field for the certificate; you will need this to configure the Agent.

    <h2>Configuring the Agent</h2>
    <p>
		With the certificate installed, you are now ready to edit the Agent's configuration file to enable SSL.
		Open the <strong>app_appSettings.config</strong> file in a text editor. This file is located in the installation
		folder of the Agent – by default, this is C:\BuildMaster\TcpAgent. Add the following key to this config file:
	</p>

    <blockquote style="font-family: Consolas, 'Courier New';">
		&lt;add key="Agent.CertificateName" value="Friendly Name"/&gt;
	</blockquote>

    <p>
		Of course, you should replace Friendly Name with the friendly name of your certificate. Once you’ve saved the config file, restart the Agent.
