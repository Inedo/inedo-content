    <p><a href="/proget/5.0">ProGet 5.0</a> is a major release with the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>New UI (<span class="major">new feature</span>)</li>
        <li>Webhooks (<span class="major">new feature</span>)</li>
        <li>NuGet feeds support SemVer 2.0</li>
        <li>Targets .NET Framework 4.5.2 (<span class="major">configuration change</span>)</li>
        <li>New SDK</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upgrade Impact</h2>
    Although this is a major release, the upgrade represents little risk for most users.
    Please see the <a href="/support/kb/1153">Upgrade from v2 and v3</a> if you are upgrading
    from a version lower than 4.0.

    <h3>New UI</h3>
    <p>
        ProGet v5.0 introduces a modified look &amp; feel that should be very familiar to users of ProGet v4.
        The only major usability changes are:
        <ul>
            <li>Vulnerabilities &amp; License Rules headings are combined under "Compliance"</li>
            <li>"Docker feeds" are now under their own heading "Containers"</li>
            <li>Administration Overview links have been reorganized</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Webhooks</h3>
    <p>
        Webhooks are a new feature; see the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/advanced/webhooks">Webhooks Documentation</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <h3>NuGet SemVer 2.0</h3>
    <p>
        Newly created NuGet feeds will support SemVer 2.0. Visit the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/feeds/nuget#legacy">Legacy (Quirks) documentation</a> to learn about migration for existing feeds.
    </p>

    <h3>Installation targets .NET Framework 4.5.2</h3>
    <p>
        ProGet v4 required NET 4.5.0, but Microsoft no longer supports that version of the framework.
        .NET Framework 4.5.2 (or newer) is now required to install ProGet.
    </p>

    <h3>SDK Changes</h3>
    <p>ProGet now serves extensions built against the Inedo SDK, so all custom extensions must be rebuilt before
    they can be used in ProGet v5.0. Learn more about  <a href="/support/documentation/various/inedo-sdk/the-sdk">the Inedo SDK</a> by visiting the documentation. </p>

    <h3>Reinstall Extensions</h3>
    <p>
        After upgrade, you may need to reinstall extensions by first deleting the files in your extensions path, and then going to Admin &gt; Extensions, and installing them from the Inedo Den.
    </p>

    <h4>Package &amp; Feed Adapters removed</h4>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4><code>PackageStore</code> replaced with <code>FileSystem</code> in SDK</h4>
    <p>
    </p>

    <h2>Upgrade Process</h2>
    <p>
            ProGet may be upgraded by running the latest installer; make sure the database gets backed up (the installer will prompt
            for this as well). Note that during upgrade, several schema changes will be applied.
    </p>

    <h2>Rollback</h2>
    <p>
        See <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/backing-up">restoring your ProGet instance</a> for how to rollback.
