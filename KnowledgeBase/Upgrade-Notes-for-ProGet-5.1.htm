    <title>Upgrade Notes for ProGet 5.1</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p><a href="/proget/5.1">ProGet 5.1</a> is a minor release with the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>Support for Docker connectors</li>
		<li>Virtual packages</li>
		<li>New installer</li>
		<li>Shared configuration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upgrade Impact</h2>
	<p>
		This is a minor release with new features and nontrivial bugfixes. Risk is minimal, but
		there is a higher chance of regression than with a maintenance release.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please see the <a href="/support/kb/1153">Upgrade from v2 and v3</a> if you are upgrading
		from a version lower than 4.0.
	</p>

    <h3>Docker Connectors</h3>
    <p>
		ProGet has supported Docker feeds for some time, but one (frequently requested) gap was
		to add connector support. Connectors to other Docker registries can now be added and managed
		just like any other feed type.
    </p>

	<h3>Virtual Packages</h3>
	<p>
		The Universal Package specification has been expanded to allow for virtual packages which are
		built on-demand from other packages.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please see the <a href="/support/documentation/upack/virtual-packages/what-is">documentation</a>
		for more information about virtual packages.
	</p>

	<h3>Inedo Hub Installer</h3>
	<p>
		ProGet now supports installation using the Inedo Hub installer. This installer offers a simplified
		experience with improved logging, and can manage other Inedo products as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="/proget/versions">traditional and manual installers</a> continue to remain available as alternatives, but once
		the Inedo Hub is used to upgrade or install a ProGet instance, the traditional installer will
		no longer be able to upgrade it.
	</p>

	<h3>Shared Configuration</h3>
	<p>
		As of ProGet 5.1.3, instances managed by either installer use a single config file for a small number
		of essential values instead of duplicated app.config and web.config appSettings sections. This new
		config file is located in <code>%ProgramData%\Inedo\SharedConfig\ProGet.config</code>. The installers will
		automatically migrate settings to this file on upgrade.
	</p>

    <h2>Upgrade Process</h2>
    <p>
		ProGet may be upgraded by running the latest installer, so make sure the database gets backed up.
		Note that during upgrade, some schema changes will be applied.
    </p>

    <h2>Rollback</h2>
    <p>
        See <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/backing-up">restoring your ProGet instance</a> for how to rollback.
