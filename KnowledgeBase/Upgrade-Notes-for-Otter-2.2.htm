    </p>

    <h3>New Features</h3>
    <h4 id="perf">Major Performance Improvements</h4>
    <p>
        We've removed many performance bottlenecks including SQL database access, plan editor initialization,
        Git raft optimization, and more. Otter will perform better in general and have a better capacity to scale.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ceip">Customer Experience &amp; Improvement Program</h4>
    <p>
        Inedo has partnered with Gibraltar Software in order to integrate Loupe with our products as part of our customer
        success initiative. This program is known as the <i>Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP)</i>,
        and this opt-in program offers several benefits to both Inedo and our customers.

        This feature is disabled by default in all existing and new installations. Visit the
        <a target="_blank" href="/support/documentation/various/ceip/overview">documentation</a>
        to learn how to opt-in, and more about what kind of data is collected and how Inedo uses it.

    <h3>Database Changes</h3>
    <p>
        Since v2.1, there are minor database schema changes, and therefore if a rollback to pre-2.2 is required, the SQL database must be
