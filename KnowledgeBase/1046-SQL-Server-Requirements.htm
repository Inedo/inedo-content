    <title>SQL Server Requirements</title>

  <body>
	<p>
		Otter, BuildMaster, Hedgehog, and ProGet for Windows all require any supported version of
		Microsoft SQL Server.
	</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>
		We recommend installing and configuring SQL Server yourself, but the installer does provide the option
		of downloading and installing SQL Express for you if you would like to get started quickly and don't
		have an existing instance to use.
	</p>
	<p> Visit Microsoft.com for more information on SQL Server Express and to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express">download the lastest versions</a>.</p>
