        For the complete listing of issues added to this release, see the release notes on the <a href="/buildmaster/versions">All Versions page</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="attention technical">
        <p>If upgrading from a pre-6.0 version, please see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/support/kb/1156">BuildMaster v6.0 Upgrade Notes</a></li>
            <li><a href="/support/kb/1117">Upgrading from v5</a> </li>
            <li><a href="/support/kb/1151">Upgrading from v3 or v4</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 id="builds">Rename "Release Packages" to "Builds"</h3>
    <p>
        This is effectively a UI-only change. While API arguments or properties that reference "packages" should be considered deprecated, any non-native endpoint
        that references them (e.g. <code>/packages/deploy</code>, <code>packageId</code> or <code>packageNumber</code>) will still accept and return those properties.
        Going forward, <code>buildId</code> and <code>buildNumber</code> should be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Compatibility with the Native API may break in this case, however most of the endpoints referenced "builds" originally.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>New Features</h3>
    <p>
        BuildMaster 6.1 includes several new CI/CD features, including:
    </p>

    <h4 id="ci">Repository Monitors &amp; Hooks</h4>
    <p>
        Support for monitoring Git repository changes at custom intervals and custom plans to execute once they are detected,
        offerring far more than was possible in existing legacy build triggers. Additionally, support has been added to accept incoming
        webhook events from GitHub and GitLab. See the
        <a target="_blank" href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/builds-and-ci#continuous-integration">documentation</a>
        for more information and examples, and also the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/inedo/inedox-git/wiki">Git extension wiki</a> for 
        hook configuration of a specific host.
    </p>

    <h4 id="variable-value-renderers">Custom Variable Value Rendering</h4>
    <p>
        Support for rendering a release or build configuration variable with custom HTML. See the
        <a target="_blank" href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/global-components/configuration-variables#value-renderers">documentation</a>
        for more information and examples.
    </p>

    <h4 id="badges">CI Badges</h4>
    <p>
        Support for generating CI badges and links using the CI Badge API. See the
        <a target="_blank" href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api/ci-badge">API documentation</a>
        for more information and examples.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ceip">Customer Experience &amp; Improvement Program</h4>
    <p>
        Inedo has partnered with Gibraltar Software in order to integrate Loupe with our products as part of our customer
        success initiative. This program is known as the <i>Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP)</i>,
        and this opt-in program offers several benefits to both Inedo and our customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        This feature is disabled by default in all existing and new installations. Visit the
        <a target="_blank" href="/support/documentation/various/ceip/overview">documentation</a>
        to learn how to opt-in, and more about what kind of data is collected and how Inedo uses it.
    </p>


    <h3 id="sdk">Legacy BuildMaster SDK</h3>
    <p>
        There is 1 possible breaking change between v6.0 and v6.1 of the BuildMaster SDK: <code>Execution<u>s</u>FailedEvent</code>
        was renamed to <code>ExecutionFailedEvent</code>. In the unlikely event that this event code was consumed by an extension, it must
        be updated to drop the "<code>s</code>", and reference the newly added <code>ExecutionId</code> event detail.
    </p>
    <div class="attention analogy">
        <p>
            Note: the Inedo SDK (available since v6.0) is not affected, and extensions built against it do not require updates.
            However, the Inedo.SDK v1.1 version is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Inedo.SDK/">available from NuGet</a> going forward.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Database Changes</h3>
    <p>
        Since v6.0, there are minor database schema changes, and therefore if a rollback to pre-6.1 were required, the SQL database must be
        <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/installation/backing-up#database-backup">restored from a backup</a>.
    </p>
