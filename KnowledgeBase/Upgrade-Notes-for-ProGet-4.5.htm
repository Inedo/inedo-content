                <b>Upgrading from a version older than 4.x?</b> It is strongly recommended that you first review <a href="/support/kb/1153/upgrading-from-proget-v2-and-v3">Upgrading from ProGet v2 and v3 </a>before proceeding.
            </p>
    <p><a href="/proget/4.5">ProGet 4.5</a> is minor release with the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ruby Gems Feed Support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upgrade Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Since the changes are entirely additive and very minor,
        the upgrade risks are negligible; the only database schema changes
        involved the creation of new tables.
    </p>

    <h2>Upgrade Process</h2>
    <p>
        ProGet may be upgraded by simply running the latest installer.
    </p>

    <h2>Rollback</h2>
    <p>
        See <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/backing-up">restoring your ProGet instance</a> for how to rollback.
