    <p><a href="/otter/1.3">Otter 1.3</a> is minor release with the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/den">Inedo Den</a> Integration (<span class="major">new feature</span>)</li>
        <li>Minor improvements and bug fixes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upgrade Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Because most of the changes are additive, the upgrade risks are negligible. There are no database schema change, but you should always
        <a href="/support/documentation/otter/administration/backing-up">back up your Otter instance</a> just in case.
    </p>

    <h3>Core Functionality to "Extensions"</h3>
    <p>
        Most of the operations and variable functions have been migrated to built-in extensions; if "nothing works" after upgrade, then most likely the extensions could not load
        due to permissions errors. But, once the extensions are loaded, there will be no functional difference at all.
    </p>
    <!--
    <h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
    <p>Because pipelines are newly generated from existing workflows, there is some risk with broken approvals and event listeners. Custom extensions may also behave differently due to several SDK Changes. To mitigate these risks: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure that your BuildMaster database is backed up prior to upgrade</li>
        <li>Make sure that the installation's \Extensions directory is backed up prior to upgrade</li>
        <li>Test deployment plans in earlier environments prior to deploying to production</li>
    </ul>
        -->

    <h2>Upgrade Process</h2>
    <p>
        Otter may be upgraded by simply running the latest installer. The agents do not need to be updated.
    </p>


    <h2>Rollback</h2>
    <p>
        Because there are no database changes, a rollback will require uninstalling Otter, and then <a href="/support/documentation/otter/administration/backing-up">restoring your Otter instance</a>.
