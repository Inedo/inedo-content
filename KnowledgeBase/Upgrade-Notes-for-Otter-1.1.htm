    <p><a href="/otter/1.1">Otter 1.1</a> is minor release with the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Support for SSH-based Servers</li>
        <li>Git-based Rafts</li>
        <li>Various bug fixes</li>
        <li>New SDK</li>
        <li>New API</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upgrade Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Because the changes are additive, the upgrade risks are negligible: there is a minor database schema change, and you can mitigate this risk by 
        <a href="/support/documentation/otter/administration/backing-up">backing-up your Otter instance</a> prior to upgrade.
    </p>
    <!--
    <h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
    <p>Because pipelines are newly generated from existing workflows, there is some risk with broken approvals and event listeners. Custom extensions may also behave differently due to several SDK Changes. To mitigate these risks: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure that your BuildMaster database is backed up prior to upgrade</li>
        <li>Make sure that the installation's \Extensions directory is backed up prior to upgrade</li>
        <li>Test deployment plans in earlier environments prior to deploying to production</li>
    </ul>
        -->

    <h2>Upgrade Process</h2>
    <p>
        Otter may be upgraded by simply running the latest installer. The agents will automatically update when the service starts again.
    </p>


    <h2>Rollback</h2>
    <p>
        Because there are database changes, a rollback will require uninstalling Otter, and then <a href="/support/documentation/otter/administration/backing-up">restoring your Otter instance</a>.
