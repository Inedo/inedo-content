    <title>Anti-malware False Positives, Code Signing, and Safety of Inedo Products</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Malware protection is meant to ensure that our systems and sensitive information aren't compromised. 
    Occasionally, this protection doesn't quite work as intended and flags a secure download; this is known as a false positive.</p>

    <h2>If it's Signed by Inedo, It's Guaranteed Safe</h2>

    <p>Rest assured that if the package is signed by Inedo, you can be certain that no &quot;viruses,&quot;
	malware, Trojans, or other malicious code were injected into our installers.</p>

    <p>All certificates are issued to Inedo by Comodo and may be viewed from the installer:</p>

    <h2>Why Code Signing Guarantees Safety</h2>

    <p>Digital signatures ensure authenticity and integrity, just as a manufacturer's brand name does
	on packaged software. However, unlike a brand name alone, these cannot be counterfeited.</p>

    <p>Code Signing uses a digital signature to assure users of the origin and reliability of software.
	In a digital signature, the private key generates the signature, and the corresponding public key validates it.
	To save time, digital signature protocols use a cryptographic digest, which is a one-way hash of the document.</p>

    <h2>How Can I <em>Really</em> be sure?</h2>

    <p>Many enterprises trust code signing certificates including <a href="http://inedo.com/users">our existing users</a>. 
    There is also a manual install process that can be configured to run with low security. 
    If you want, you can even <a href="http://inedo.com/company/source-code-request">request our source code</a> for inspection.</p>

    <h2>Please Report the False Positive!</h2>

    <p>Please let your malware protection provider know about the false positive; the more people who do, the greater the chance they won't flag these in the future.</p>
