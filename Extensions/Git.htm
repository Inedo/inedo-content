            <p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a free, distributed source control management tool. This extension includes a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/toolset-integration/source-control">Source Control Provider</a> for Git.</p>

            <h2>Using the Git Extension</h2>

            <p>This Git Source Control Provider contained within this extension wraps the Git Command Line Client (<code>git</code>, or <code>git.exe</code> in Windows) to provide standard BuildMaster operations of getting latest, labeling, and getting by label. Please refer to the <a href="/support/kb/1028/integrating-buildmaster-and-git">Integrating BuildMaster and Git</a> knowledge base article for more information.</p>

            <h2>About Git</h2>

            <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Here are some of the key features from the Git website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Branching and Merging - Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.</li>
                <li>Small and Fast - Git is fast. With Git, nearly all operations are performed locally, giving it a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with a server somewhere.</li>
                <li>Distributed - Git is distributed, which means instead of doing a "checkout" of the current tip of the source code, you do a "clone" of the entire repository.</li>
                <li>Data Assurance - The data model that Git uses ensures the cryptographic integrity of every bit of your project. Every file and commit is checksummed and retrieved by its checksum when checked back out. It's impossible to get anything out of Git other than the exact bits you put in.</li>
                <li>Staging Area - Unlike the other systems, Git has something called the "staging area" or "index". This is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.</li>
                <li>Free and Open Source - Git is released under the <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/osd" target="_blank">GPLv2 open source license</a>. This means that you are free to inspect the source code at any time or contribute to the project yourself.</li>
            </ul>
