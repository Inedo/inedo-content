				<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/">YouTrack</a> is
				an agile issue tracking and project tracking tool.
			</p>

			<h2>Using the YouTrack Extension</h2>
			<p>
				The YouTrack extension contains an issue tracking provider which
				allows BuildMaster to query a YouTrack instance for the issues
				associated with each release. Additionally, this extension allows
				BuildMaster to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Block promotion until all YouTrack issues are resolved</li>
				<li>Change status of YouTrack issues with a deployment plan action</li>
				<li>Write a comment to YouTrack issues with a deployment plan action</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Configurating an Issue Tracker in BuildMaster</h2>
			<p>
				See <a href="/support/tutorials/adding-an-issue-tracking-provider-to-buildmaster">Adding an Issue Tracking Provider to BuildMaster</a>
				for a tutorial on setting up an issue tracker in BuildMaster.
