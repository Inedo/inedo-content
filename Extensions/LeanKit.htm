               <a href="http://leankitkanban.com">LeanKit Kanban</a> allows
               organizations from 5 to 5,000 to harness the power of visual management.
           </p>
           <p>
               <strong>Optimize the Flow of Work: </strong>Build visual models of any process in just minutes.
               Then use this model to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies,
               and showstoppers. Improve delivery date performance
               while reducing waste and rework.
           </p>
           <p>
               <strong>Focus on Customer Value: </strong>Understand your team's real capacity, and make informed priority
               decisions. Manage the value-adding activities in your process and
               focus on delivering a continuous flow of customer value.
           </p>
           <p>
               <strong>Collaborate Anywhere in Real Time: </strong>Automated notifications, RSS feeds, and a host of other communication
               features keep all stakeholders aware of work status, whether they are
               located in the same room or the other side of the globe.
           </p>
           <p>
               <strong>See Real, Meaningful Metrics: </strong>No more estimates, guesswork, and lies about "percent complete".
               LeanKit Kanban captures real-time process data as you use it, helping
               you to measure your team's efficiency, identify problems before they
               happen, and predict future performance.
           </p>

           <h2><strong>Using LeanKit Kanban with BuildMaster</strong></h2>
           <p>
               LeanKit Kanban is a hosted service, so your BuildMaster server must have access to the Internet for this extension to work.
               The LeanKit Kanban extension includes a BuildMaster Issue Tracking Provider that allows you to treat a Kanban board as a BuildMaster
               application's issue tracker. If you are unfamiliar with configuring Issue Tracking Providers in BuildMaster, see
               <a href="http://inedo.com/support/kb/1006/integrating-an-issue-tracker-with-buildmaster">Integrating an Issue Tracker with BuildMaster</a>.
           </p>

           <h3>Configuring the Kanban Provider</h3>
           <p>
               The Kanban Provider in BuildMaster requires a few pieces of information to connect to the hosted service.
           </p>
           <img style="display: inline; border: 1px solid grey;" class="screenshot" title="Kanban Provider" alt="Kanban Provider" src="/resources/knowledgebase/b2b963898db8_C2BF_image_3.png" width="699" height="278" />
           <p>
               Issues in BuildMaster are always associated with a Release, so you must tag your cards with an appropriate Release Number for BuildMaster
               to match them up with active Releases. The default format of <em>rel-%RELNO%</em> will allow you to use tags like <em>rel-1.0</em> or
               <em>rel-1.2.5</em> (depending on your BuildMaster Release Numbering Scheme), but you may use any format you would like.
           </p>
           <p>
               The name of your LeanKit account is also required, along with logon credentials which BuildMaster can use to view and/or update cards.
           </p>

           <h3>Associating a Board with an Application</h3>
           <p>
               Select <strong>Issue Tracker</strong> from the <strong>Settings</strong> drop-down menu on the application navigation bar that you
               would like to associate with your Kanban board, and choose the newly-created LeanKit Kanban Provider from the dropdown box. Next,
               select the board from the <strong>Board</strong> dropdown box and click <strong>Save</strong>.
           </p>

           <h3>Issue Status and Actions</h3>
           <img style="display: inline" class="screenshot" title="Kanban Cards" alt="Kanban Cards" src="/resources/knowledgebase/b2b963898db8_C2BF_image_6.png" width="640" height="112" />
           <p>
               Once associated, you should now be able to view cards as issues on the Release Overview page of your application.
               All cards on the selected board with a tag matching the BuildMaster Release Number will be displayed in the <strong>Issues</strong>
               section along with a link to the specific card in LeanKit Kanban.
           </p>
           <img style="display: inline" class="screenshot" title="BuildMaster Issues" alt="BuildMaster Issues" src="/resources/knowledgebase/b2b963898db8_C2BF_image_9.png" width="442" height="153" />
           <p>
               Card titles are displayed <strong>in bold</strong> while the lane which the card currently occupies is displayed next to the title (in parentheses).
               If the card has a description, it is displayed below the title. Cards occupying the final lane of a board are regarded as closed issues in
               BuildMaster &ndash; they will be displayed with a green check mark instead of the standard blue diamond icon.
           </p>
           <p>
               The LeanKit Kanban Provider includes support for all of the standard Issue&ndash;Tracking BuildMaster actions:
           </p>
           <ul>
               <li>
                   <strong>Append Issue Description</strong> &ndash; Appends text to the description of a card
               </li>
               <li>
                   <strong>Change Issue Status</strong> &ndash; Moves all of the cards from one lane to another lane
               </li>
               <li>
                   <strong>Close Issues</strong> &ndash; Moves all of the cards to the final lane
               </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
               Additionally, the <strong>Issue Tracker Status</strong> Promotion Requirement may be used to block promotion of a
               Release until all of the cards are in a specific lane.
