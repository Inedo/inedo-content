               scalable, and inexpensive computing platform "in the cloud."

               AWS is a cloud service, so your BuildMaster server must have access to the Internet for this extension to work. The Amazon extension includes
               Actions for performing AWS tasks as part of your deployment plans.
           </p>

           <h2><strong>Using AWS with BuildMaster</strong></h2>

           <h3>EC2 and S3</h3>
           <p>
               This extension includes Actions which allow BuildMaster to manage EC2 instances and S3 storage buckets.
           </p>

           <h4>EC2 Actions</h4>
           <p>The extension includes Actions for managing EC2 instances:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>
                   <strong>Create Amazon EC2 Instance</strong> - Creates a new EC2 instance using a specified image ID, and optionally associates it with a specified IP address.
               </li>
               <li>
                   <strong>Terminate Amazon EC2 Instance</strong> - Terminates an EC2 instance with a specified ID or public IP address.
               </li>
           </ul>

           <h4>S3 Actions</h4>
           <p>
               An Action is also available for uploading files from any BuildMaster Server/Agent to an S3 bucket.
           </p>

           <h3>CloudFormation</h3>
           <p>
               The extension also includes Actions which allows BuildMaster to create, control and manage CloudFormation stacks.
           </p>
           <p>
               <ul>
                   <li>
                       <strong>Deploy CloudFormation Template</strong> - Deploys a new CloudFormation stack from a template stored in an S3 bucket,
                       as a configuration file or as text within the action.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       <strong>Wait For CloudFormation Stack Creation</strong> - Waits for a CloudFormation stack to complete initialization.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       <strong>Delete CloudFormation Stack</strong> - Deletes a CloudFormation stack and optionally waits for the deletion to finish.
                   </li>
               </ul>
           </p>
           <p>
               The <a href="/buildmaster/features/platforms/aws">features</a> provide a rich set of functionality to manage
               CloudFormation templates, scaling and security.
           </p>

           <h3>Extension Configuration</h3>
           <p>
               To connect to AWS, you will need an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. See
               <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSecurityCredentials/1.0/AboutAWSCredentials.html">Amazon's documentation</a> for help setting this up.
               To add this information to BuildMaster, click the <strong>Extension Configuration</strong> link in any of the AWS-related Actions.
           </p>
