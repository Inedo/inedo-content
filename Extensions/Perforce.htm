                Perforce is a commercial, proprietary, centralized revision control system developed by <a href="http://perforce.com/">Perforce Software, Inc.</a>
                This extension includes a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/toolset-integration/source-control">Source Control Provider</a> for Perforce.
            </p>

            <h3>Using the Perforce Extension</h3>
                <p>
                    The Perforce Source Control Provider contained within this extension wraps the Perforce Command-Line Client
                    (<code>p4</code>, or <code>p4.exe</code> on Windows) to provide standard BuildMaster operations of getting latest, labeling,
                    and getting by label.
                </p>

            <h3>Configuring the Perforce Client on Your Server</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two clients that are <a href="http://www.perforce.com/downloads/complete_list">freely available</a> from Perforce: 
                    P4 and P4V. The "V" in P4V stands for Visual, and contains both the P4 Command-Line Client and a graphical interface. 
                    The visual client is easier to work with, especially if you're not familiar with with all the various command-line options. 
                    We generally recommend installing P4V, even though BuildMaster will only use P4. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A connection to a Perforce Server requires four key pieces of data: 
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>User Name</strong> ("P4USER") - the username to login into the Perforce Server
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Password</strong> ("P4PASSWD") - the user's password
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Workspace Name</strong> ("P4CLIENT") - the server-defined workspace to use
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Perforce Server</strong> ("P4PORT") - the server and port number
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Creating a Client Workspace</h3>
                <p>
                    A Perforce client workspace is a set of files on a machine that mirror a subset of the files in the depot. 
                    Creating a client workspace is relatively simple from P4V, but it can also be accomplished with P4 with the following steps: 
                </p>
                <blockquote style="font-family: consolas, 'Courier New', courier">md c:\p4workspaces\user1_workspace1    <br />cd c:\p4workspaces\user1_workspace1     <br />p4 -u {username} -P {password} -p {server:port} client user1_workspace1 </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The P4 command will cause a text editor (default: notepad) to open, and once you close it the client workspace ("user1_workspace1") will be created. 
                    In future editions of the BuildMaster Perforce Extension, we may automatically create this for you, but for now, it requires a simple command. 
                </p>
