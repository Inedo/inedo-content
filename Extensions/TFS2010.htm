      <p class="announcement">
		 This extension has been deprecated in favor of the <a href="/buildmaster/extensions/tfs">TFS Extension</a>.
      </p>
	  <h2>TFS Extension vs TFS2010 Extension</h2>
	  <p>
		The newer, <a href="/buildmaster/extensions/tfs">TFS Extension</a> was essentially a fork of this extension, and all future development is being
		done against the TFS Extension. The primary reason for the switch was to lessen the confusion between which version of TFS is required for which
		extension and to support all versions of TFS going forward.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Deprecation &amp; Compatibility</h2>
	  <p>
		We stopped actively maintaining this extension as of <a href="/buildmaster/4.4">BuildMaster v4.4</a>; it will remain functional through
		BuildMaster 5.0, at which point the installer will automatically convert the TFS2010 providers to TFS providers and require that you download
		the TFS extension. If you wish to do this  sooner, contact us through our <a href="/support">support channels</a>.
	  </p>
		<p>This extension is compatible with Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010 (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997788.aspx">Microsoft's TFS Client/Server Compatibility</a> for more information), and includes actions and providers for:</p>
	  <ul>
		 <li>source control integration</li>
		 <li>work item integration</li>
		 <li>creating builds in TFS Team Build</li>
		 <li>importing artifacts from TFS Team Build build drop locations</li>
	  </ul>
		<h4>Licensing Requirements</h4>
	  <p>Due to Microsoft licensing requirements, before the TFS extension can integrate with any part of TFS, the appropriate version of Team Explorer must be installed on the build server that intends on accessing TFS services. The required editions can be found here:</p>
	  <ul>
		 <li>2010 (ISO): <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=329">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=329</a></li>
	  </ul>
