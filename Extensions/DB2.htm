      <h3>Integrating DB2 and BuildMaster</h3>
      <p>
         This extension includes a database provider which allows BuildMaster's database integration to work with IBM DB2
         database software.
      </p>
      <p>
         In order for this extension to communicate with DB2, the <b>IBM Data Server Driver Package</b> must be installed on
         the server that will connect to the database (either the BuildMaster server itself, or a server with
         a BuildMaster agent installed on it).
