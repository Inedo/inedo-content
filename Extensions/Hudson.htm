                The Hudson extension includes actions for both creating builds in Hudson and retrieving/extracting artifacts from the Hudson server.
                For this extension to work correctly, the BuildMaster server must be able to access the Hudson server.
            </p>

            <h2>Extension Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                Before using the Hudson actions, the extension must be configured. Once installed from the extension gallery, select "Admin",
                and "Add/Configure BuildMaster Extensions" under Extensibility from the administration page. At the bottom of the page is a button
                to "Configure or Delete Extensions". Look for the Hudson extension and click on the Edit icon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choose "Set/override the default values" and fill in the appropriate server URL and credentials <br />
                (if desired). Leaving the username/password blank will use anonymous authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, when configuring the extension set a correct value for the Build Delay setting. This setting controls the amount of time
                BuildMaster will wait after triggering a build so as to allow the Hudson quiet period to elapse before BuildMaster checks the build status.
            </p>

            <h2>Creating a Build in Hudson from BuildMaster</h2>
            <p>
                To create a build in Hudson, add the "Trigger Hudson Build" action to any deployment plan. <br />
                For BuildMaster to be able to run a build, it needs to know the build's job name.
            </p>
            <!--In the future a screenshot should go here... like the jenkins extension page-->
            <p>
                The additional parameters field are supplied in the same manner as if you were accessing the Hudson API via HTTP.
                You can view details on specifying additional build parameters <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Parameterized+Build"
                                                                                  target="_blank">on the Hudson wiki page</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the "Wait for build to complete" option is checked, then BuildMaster will continually ping the Hudson server and the action will wait
                until the jobs building status is no longer "true".
            </p>

            <h2>Getting an Artifact From Hudson</h2>
            <p>
                BuildMaster allows you to get artifacts from a Hudson server and either download it to an output directory, or extract its contents to an
                output directory. Simply add the "Get Hudson Artifact" to your deployment plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                To configure this action, you must specify either an artifact name or "*" to indicate all artifacts in the build.
                You must also specify the job name (from above) and the build number. The build number can be an actual specific build
                number or one of the predefined constants from the list below. The final option is whether or not to extract the artifact
                into the output directory (if the artifact is a zip file) or to just copy the artifact.
            </p>
            <p>
                The predefined constants for the job builds are:
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>"lastBuild"</li>
                    <li>"lastCompletedBuild"</li>
                    <li>"lastFailedBuild"</li>
                    <li>"lastStableBuild"</li>
                    <li>"lastSuccessfulBuild"</li>
                    <li>"lastUnsuccessfulBuild"</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
