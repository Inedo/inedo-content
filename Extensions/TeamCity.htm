    <h1>Integrating TeamCity and BuildMaster</h1>
    <p>
        Although BuildMaster has Continuous Integration (CI) features, it is not designed solely as a CI server. <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">JetBrains 
        TeamCity</a>, on the other hand, is designed specifically to solve the problem of CI and has several features that
        BuildMaster does not. For a more detailed comparison, see <a href="/support/kb/1023/a-comparison-between-buildmaster-vs-teamcity">
        KB #1023: BuildMaster vs. TeamCity</a>.
    </p><p>
        By integrating with BuildMaster, different users can easily deploy TeamCity artifacts to various
        environments, whether in-house or on the cloud.

    <p>This combination of tools offer several advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deploy from existing TeamCity configurations</li>
        <li>Use advanced features only offered by TeamCity</li>
        <li>Maintain separation of build/deployment responsibilities</li>
    </ul>
