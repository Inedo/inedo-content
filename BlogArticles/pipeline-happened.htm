    <h1>Pipeline 2016 was a Success!</h1>
    <p>
        Here’s our quick update for those of you who couldn’t attend Pipeline 2016.

    <p>
        This year's conference had a fantastic turnout! Seeing all the positive feedback on twitter with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/piplineconf">#pipelineconf</a>, or 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/PipelineConf">@pipelineconf</a>, is awesome and inspiring. We're glad everyone had a good time. The talks were top notch per usual, but we expected no less from the 
        enthusiastic Continuous Delivery community. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you couldn't make it this year, or you missed one of your favorite speakers, have no fear! Pipeline has begun uploading the talks like they did last year, <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/pipelineconf/160945085">Jez Humble's</a> is already up!
        Here's a link to their <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/pipelineconf/videos">Vimeo page</a> so you can re-watch your favorite 2015 talks,
        (we highly recommend Linda Rising's, who was another one of our awesome <a href="/release">Release!</a> face cards) and stay up to date as they upload the talks from 2016. 
    </p>

        For those of you who attended, we hope you enjoyed the Inedo sponsorship swag. We know your laptops always have more room for stickers, 
        and it's fun for us to give conference goers a sneak peek at our up and coming projects. (Which actually has recently launched, so get in the know, and 
        check out <a href="/offset">Code Offsets</a> now!)

        If you're in search of an in-depth overview of the conference in its entirety, the folks over at <a href="https://skeltonthatcher.com/blog/pipeline-conference-2016/">Skelton Thatcher</a> 
        were nice enough to put together one long blog post, just for you. For a more personal blog post about his experience at Pipeline 2016, one of the speakers, <a href="https://twitter.com/archtavo">Gustavo Elias</a>
        (How To Deal With A Hot Potato), wrote an insightful quick read on some of his favorite talks. Be sure to <a href="https://labs.ig.com/pipeline-conference-2016-review">check it out!</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        And as every conference must draw to a close, so must this blog post. We were proud to have been a sponsor of Pipeline 2016, and would like to thank you all for having us. 
        We are already looking forward to the speakers for next year, and the interesting topics they'll manage to come up with!
