  <h1>Webinar Recap : Managing Vulnerabilities with ProGet</h1>

  <p>
      Most of today's software is dependent on 3rd party components, which is why many organizations choose to use a tool like <a href="/proget">ProGet</a> to manage their repositories. But when your code is coming from an outside source, you also need to ensure that all of the code introduced into your software, isn't also introducing security risks.   </p>
   <p>
      In our most recent webinar, Ken Duck from <a href="https://vorsecurity.com/">V&ouml;r Security</a> shows us how these vulnerabilities get built into our systems, and how to use ProGet with the V&ouml;r Security integration to identify and quickly assess those risk factors.  We want to thank Ken once again, as well as our audience.

      We recorded the webinar and posted it on YouTube so you can watch or share the whole webinar at your convenience. We also have made sure to include a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8YrIuipE1c" target="blank">quick cut</a> that shows you how to get set up with the ProGet - V&ouml;r Security integration in about 10 minutes.
