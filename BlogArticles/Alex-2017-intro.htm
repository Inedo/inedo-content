    <p>
        With all the “I wanted to personally thank you for a great 2016” messages you’re certainly getting, it’s gonna be pretty hard to 
        stand out and sound sincere, but I’m gonna try!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2016 was great</strong>, and we couldn't have done it without you, the Inedo Community.
    </p>
    <p>
        I really mean it. Unlike every other major DevOps vendor, we are not flush with venture capital. We're bootstrapped. Self-funded. 
        That means we need to actually focus on serving our customers' needs, not investors eying for a quick exit. I know. Sounds crazy. 
        But it's been working!
    </p>
    <p>
        Last year, after receiving so much great advice from so many of you, we completed our largest strategic shift since becoming a 
        single-product company in 2011. We now have a <a href="/products">unified product suite</a> that works great together and with 
        other tools, and Inedo is widely seen as the DevOps vendor with extremely powerful, yet very easy-to-use tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        This year, many of you suggested that we focus on the Inedo Community. So let's do that!
    </p>
    <p>
        I realize that you all work in different industries and at companies of all sizes, but there's still a lot to learn from each other, 
        and to share with others (without breaking NDA):
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
        <ul>
            <li><i>Did you find an actual, tangible benefit to DevOps?</i></li>
            <li><i>If you had to do it over again, what would you do differently?</i></li>
            <li><i>How did you change your organizational culture?</i></li>
            <li><i>Why did your organization want to automate or “go DevOps”, in the first place?</i></li>
            <li><i>Where did you start?</i></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once again, I'd love your advice.
    </p>
    <p>
        How can we share your success and expertise within our own community, and the larger DevOps and IT community?
    </p>
   <p>
       Can we help by sponsoring your local user group/meetup/<a href="/blog/encouraging-collaboration-in-the-workplace">hackathon</a>?
   </p>
    <p>
        Are there any conferences we should attend?
    </p>
    <p>
        Your thoughts and advice are always appreciated! I'm always happy to do a quick chat or call, 
        so don't hesitate to reach out to me directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sincerely,
    </p>
