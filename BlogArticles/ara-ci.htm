    <h1>Application Release Automation and its role in the DevOps toolchain</h1>
   
    <p>Recently, I ran across a great blog post by our friends over at <a href="http://automic.com/">Automic Software</a>. 
    The post highlighted the relationship between Application Release Automation and Continuous Integration and how tools in each category fulfill a different role in a DevOps toolchain.</p>

    <p>As vendors in the ARA market, we get asked this question all the time: &ldquo;Well, can&rsquo;t I just use *insert CI tool* for my deployment?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Now when answering, we always make sure to explain <em>why </em>&nbsp;this isn&rsquo;t a best practice or really the appropriate use case for CI tools; I think the Automic post lays it out very nicely:</p>

    <blockquote> "ARA addresses a broader use case than CI, which includes, among many things, separation of duties, approvals, compliance audits, auto-scaling, and being able to work within the rigors and confines of secure production environments" </blockquote>

    <p>CI tools are great at what they do but they aren&rsquo;t meant to take a build through multiple different stages and environments to production &ndash; that&rsquo;s where ARA tools come in. CI and ARA tools are just two of the many tools that are often implemented as part of a DevOps toolchain.</p>
