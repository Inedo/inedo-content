    <h1 style="padding: 20px 0; text-align: center;">The importance of saving your assets in a private repository</h1>
    <p>
        Yesterday, we were reminded yet again, why keeping your assets solely in the cloud isn't the best option.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a> published an article titled: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14765042/amazon-s3-outage-causing-trouble?yptr=yahoo">
            Amazon's web servers are down and it's causing trouble across the internet
        </a>, and we're having flashbacks of
        <a href="/blog/why-you-absolutely-need-a-private-repository-a-response-to-npmgate">#npmgate</a>. In this time of
        outages, we would like to remind our users how important it is to have your assets in a private repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having access to your packages is a vital component to your development process, and
        that's why it's critical to make sure you can actually access them. By using a Universal Package Manager,
        like <a href="/proget">ProGet</a>, you ensure that your packages are easily, and readily available. 
        ProGet allows you to connect to outside repositories and cache a copy of your packages locally, giving you 
        complete control, instead of relying on a third party. Caching locally makes it easy to maintain your packages
        in times of an outage, thus decreasing possible downtime and making your builds more reliable.
