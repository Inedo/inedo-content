    <h1>Deployment Automation vs. Infrastructure as Code</h1>
    <p>
        Karl wrote an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/devops-tools-deployment-automation-vs-infrastructure-code-harnagy">intriguing article</a>
        breaking down the specifics of comparing Deployment Automation tools to Infrastructure as Code tools.

    <p>
        He bridges the gap with a clever metaphor involving Air Jordans vs. Tesla. He goes on to explain how a side-by-side comparison of the two doesn't quite cover what you need to know; even still,
        there's nothing wrong with having, and using, both tools.

    <p>
        He also delves into why Infrastructure as Code tools are becoming a DevOps preference for application package deployment, and also gives us a valuable reminder
        that there is no one-size-fits-all DevOps tool. Knowing your organizational needs first is the key to choosing the right tools, and successfully implementing DevOps best practices.
