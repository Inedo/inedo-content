    <h1>Welcome to our new blog!</h1>
    <p>
        Our blog was looking a little stale and we knew it was time for a solid re-design.
    </p>
    <p>
        So check out the new look! As well as the new design, we've got quite a few blog topics in the works that we're excited to start sharing with you.
        These will give you some unique behind-the-scenes insight into what life at Inedo is like for us. We hope you're all as excited as we are for this new chapter of the blog,
        and we look forward to continue providing you with great content.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have a great idea for a blog topic/post, or want to know more about the cool stuff we get to do? <a href=" /contact">Contact us!</a>
        We would love to hear what content you like seeing, and what about Inedo you find interesting.
    </p>
