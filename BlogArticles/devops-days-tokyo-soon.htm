    <p> 
        DevOpsDays Tokyo 2017 is taking place Tuesday, Apr 25, 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're excited to be a part of a growing DevOps movement in Japan, including our involvement in organizing and sponsoring <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-tokyo/welcome/">DevOps Days Tokyo 2017</a>! This event will provide a forum for the IT community to discuss and share challenges, successes, and best practices for making culture changes, and adopting DevOps tools within Japanese organizations.

        In case you're interested, here's the schedule:

        Also, keep an eye out for our announcement about Inedo in Japan! We've recently hit our ten year anniversary, and we couldn't think of a better way to celebrate, than beginning our expansion into the Japanese Market.
