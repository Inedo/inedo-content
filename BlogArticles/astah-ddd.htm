        Does Modeling Have a Place in DevOps?
    </h1>
    <p> 
        Team building, better communication, and faster quality changes are some of the most basic tenets of DevOps. Finding a way to combine all three aspects is a challenge many organizations face. While there is no 'one-size fits all' solution, a good place to start might be an Application Model.

        Our teammate just posted an interesting article on devops.com, talking about how an Application Model represents the application as it exists in the real world, with all its benefits and flaws. He further goes on to show how the model can be a great place to start when considering changes to an established application. Even more so if the team is interested, or working towards, a better DevOps environment.
