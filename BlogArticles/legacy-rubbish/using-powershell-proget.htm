    <h1>Using PowerShell to Install and Configure ProGet</h1>
    <p>
        Since ProGet supports silent installation, it is pretty straightforward to automatically deploy it as part of a script. 
        However, it is also possible to use the SQL API to add some standard initial configuration.

    <h2>Install-ProGet Script [<a href="/resources/examples/Install-ProGet.ps1">download</a>]</h2>
    <p>
        We put together a simple PowerShell script that installs ProGet using a ProGetSetup.exe installer that is in the same directory as the script, 
        deletes the default NuGet feed, and creates a new Chocolatey feed. It also optionally changes the default Admin password and a few other settings.

        Of course, this script will probably just be a starting point for your specific scenario. Feel free to download it and modify it any way you want.
