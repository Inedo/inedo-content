    <h2>Announcing ProGet 2.0 and ProGet Client Tools</h2>
    <p class="announcement">
        <i>April 25, 2014</i> - While these tools were never officially supported, the ProGet Client Tools are being officially removed due
        to extreme lack of demand. We will still offer the ProGet.exe tool for automated deployment and testing scenarios, but will only support its
        use in conjunction with a valid BuildMaster license.
    </p>

    <h3>ProGet Command-Line Client</h3>
    <p>
        The ProGet Command-Line Client is designed as a light-weight
        alternative to nuget.exe, and is intended for use in build
        automation scripts and tools (such as BuildMaster). In addition
        to parallel package installation and requiring explicit unbounded
        dependencies, proget.exe offers <strong>
            Solution-level Package
            Installation
        </strong>. This allows you to specify a directory
        instead of a packages.config file to acquire and install all
        packages needed, and only once.
