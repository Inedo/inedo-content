    <p>Monday, October 2nd, I spent the day at the DevOpsDays Paris conference called <a href="http://www.devopsrex.fr/">DevOps REX</a> (a play on words as the event took place at the REX theater, but also was promoted as being 100% "Retour d'EXperience," or feedback-driven). All talks were conducted in French, and with close to 800 participants, it had doubled in size since last year's event. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Their self-proclaimed three ambitions for this conference were:
    </p>

    <ol style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
        <li>Innovate with this idea of a conference talking only about the feedback and results of DevOps, no technical talks or product placement in talks (although there were sponsors who had brief stage time), in order to show francophones how the concept and culture has taken place in their companies, from startups to nationwide enterprises.</li>
        <li>Show that the French are pioneers of the DevOps methodology and are working to forward its stronghold and not just rely on foreign countries to lead the way.</li>
        <li>Set the bar high from the start in order to be on the same level as the most prestigious international conferences.</li>
    </ol>

    <div style="border: 8px solid #57bdfe; color: #57bdfe; padding: 10px 30px; float: left; width: 200px; margin-right: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-weight: bolder;">
        <p>
            "<i>The success of this event has been a huge victory for the francophone DevOps community, and French IT in general.</i>"
        </p>
    </div>

    <p> Living in France myself, it was really exciting for me to be a part of this victory. The ambiance was lively, people were excited to share ideas and meet others in the field, and to be able to speak freely in their native tongue instead of struggling to do their ideas justice in English. In between the ten talks, there were four breaks where all the attendees could gather over coffee and a croissant, finger foods, and a 100% organic lunch. A bit crowded, perhaps, but the proximity of your neighbor made it impossible to keep to yourself, and throughout the day there was a convivial atmosphere with easy conversation and a tangible sense of excitement.</p>

    <p>As for the talks which emphasized individual companies' successes (and failures) in their approaches to integrating DevOps, two stood out in particular.

    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.devopsrex.fr/cth_speaker/laurent-nyffels/">Laurent Nyffels</a> with AXA (insurance and banking) gave an interesting feedback on "<i>What advantages can an ISD the size of France's AXA gain from integrating DevOps?</i>" He focused on their use of feature teams, composed of squads, tribes, and guilds that cooperated together across different levels of the nationwide enterprise with successes most notably in bringing down technical debt and deploying more frequently and without interrupting service. He spoke to the importance of listening to Ops and their delivery constraints in order to ameliorate the process. Nyffels was adamant that while tools played a large part in DevOps, the teaching and training of employees at AXA to adapt the mindset and culture shift of DevOps was just as vital to its success. Where he saw failures along the way, was when people ignored one or the other.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Another talk that peaked my interest was <a href="http://www.devopsrex.fr/cth_speaker/jeremie-garnier/">Jeremie Garnier's</a>: "<i>'Unconferences' at the heart of DevOps evangelization at Cisco</i>" (a digital transformation company). He explained how this idea of unconferences allows for an open space, free and open to all participants, to share experiences, knowledge, and culture. It is directed by the participants themselves, who manage what will be on the agenda of the multiple share-rooms. One of the "rules" at these unconferences is that at all times you must either be learning something new, or sharing something with the group; if you are not, you must move to a different meeting space where you can do one or the other. Garnier's DevOps community has grown over the last four years since they began hosting these unconferences to help solve the problem in communication and collaboration and to promote DevOps culture. With a huge success, Cisco plans to continue to hold these unconferences yearly and encourages other interested people to start communities and unconferences of their own wherever they are.</p>

    <p>At the end of these interesting and informative talks, I joined most of the other attendees for the "ap&eacute;ro" &ndash; France's version of after-work drinks. DevOps REX served up some artisanal draft beer and soda, and of course some French wine. It was refreshing to attend such a forward-thinking conference with an emphasis on the experience, with an effort to be ecologically responsible, and with such a sociable milieu.</p>

    <p>Pictures and videos from the event will be posted in the near future.
