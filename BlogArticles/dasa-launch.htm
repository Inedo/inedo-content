    <h1>Launching DASA: DevOps Agile Skills Association</h1>

    <p>    
        DASA, established with the objective of building a Universal Qualification Program for DevOps, is a non-profit organization that provides an open, global community for DevOps and Agile skills development. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re excited to be a part of this initiative and fuel the transition to DevOps by helping define DevOps roles and the learning objectives for those roles.
