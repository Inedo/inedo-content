    <p>
        We are pleased to announce that ProGet 3.6.0 is now available as a beta release!
        (Visit the <a href="https://inedo.com/proget/versions">all versions</a> download page
        to try it out.) ProGet 3.6's features and improvements are based largely on feedback
        from active users. Read on to find out what's new!
    </p>

    <h3>Feed Retention</h3>
    <p>
        This has probably been our most-requested feature, and so we are happy to introduce
        <strong>feed retention rules</strong> in ProGet 3.6! You can now define rules to
        delete/clean up old packages in your feeds. Rules can be defined with specific disk
        space quotas, constrained to only cached packages, only prerelease packages, and
        much more.
    </p>
    <p><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/news-articles/proget-3.6-beta-available/retention-rule.png" alt="Retention Rule" /></p>
    <p>
        Retention rules can be defined for every type of feed except Bower, as ProGet does
        not store any on-disk packages for Bower. Note that as of version 3.6.0, retention
        rules for Maven preview feeds are not currently run. These will be implemented
        before Maven support is officially released in ProGet 3.7.
    </p>

    <h3>Scheduled Tasks</h3>
    <p>
        ProGet has to perform occasional long-running tasks that can consume a large
        number of system resources. All feed types perform periodic consistency checks
        and retention jobs, and some connector types require indexes to be downloaded
        and reconstructed on the ProGet server. Previously, these background jobs
        where handled by the ProGet service each in different ways, and with limited
        logging and scheduling options.
    </p>
    <p><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/news-articles/proget-3.6-beta-available/scheduled-task.png" alt="Scheduled Task" /></p>
    <p>
        ProGet 3.6 unifies all of these operations as <strong>scheduled tasks</strong>,
        and provides a page to view and manage all such tasks in the system. By default,
        intensive jobs are scheduled to run in early morning hours when they are less likely
        to impact active users. Jobs can be scheduled, disabled, or run manually, and
        rich logging is provided for everything.
    </p>

    <h3>Disk Usage Metrics</h3>
    <p>
        We were also able to leverage some of the new retention logic to provide a
        graphical representation of the disk space your ProGet feeds are using. The
        main dashboard page now displays the sizes of all of your feeds, and each
        feed administration page breaks this down further by showing the space used
        by cached packages, and the largest packages in the feed.
    </p>

    <h3>UI Tweaks and Consistency</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to a new feed management page, we now prominently display each
        feed's endpoint URL on the browse feed page. This should make it much easier
        to find exactly what URL you need to supply to NuGet/npm/Bower/etc.
    </p>
