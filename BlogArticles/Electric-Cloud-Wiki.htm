    <h1>New Release Management Resource</h1>
    <p>
       If you havenâ€™t seen it yet, our friends over at <a href="http://electric-cloud.com/">Electric Cloud</a> have been gathering 
        all sorts of information, articles, and tools concerning the ever-expanding topic of Release Management. We're big fans
        of trying to find and use common words to describe what enterprises are doing, and this is a great step towards that.
    </p>

	<p>
	    This new, vendor-agnostic <a href="http://electric-cloud.com/wiki/display/releasemanagement/Release+Management">Release Management Wiki</a>
        features thousands of different resources, including all the different tools available, as well as descriptions and articles of common terms, as well as 
        learning resources for discovering best practices. 
	</p>
	
    <p>
        Everything is broken out in categories like 
        <a href="http://electric-cloud.com/wiki/display/releasemanagement/Release+Automation">Release Automation</a>, 
        <a href="http://electric-cloud.com/wiki/display/releasemanagement/Release+Management+Process">Release Management Process</a>
        <a href="http://electric-cloud.com/wiki/display/releasemanagement/Software+Deployment">Software Deployment</a>,
        and more.
    </p>
	
	<p>
	    The Release Management Wiki already has a ton of great content and links, and we're looking forward to watching this resource grow.
        Great Job Electric-Cloud!
