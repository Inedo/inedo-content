  <h1>NuGet Training: Using Multiple Package Repositories</h1>

    <p>
        Many of you attended the NuGet virtual training seminar we hosted recently. And many more of you have asked if the training videos would be made publicly available. Good news! We've started uploading parts of the training to Inedo's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Inedollc">YouTube Channel</a>.   
        </p>
    <p>
       This first video covers why it makes sense for developers to use multiple package repositories. Over the coming weeks we'll continue to highlight more of these short form videos taken from the training.
