  <h1>These two cuties named Linus &amp; Lucy. A pair of North American River Otters!</h1>
    <p>
        Being the cool people that we are, we saw a fun opportunity to do a little bit of good within our community.
    </p>

  <p>
      In honor of the 2016 release of <a href="/otter">Otter</a> 1.0 we decided to 
      sponsor two otters located at <a href="https://www.cmnh.org/">The Cleveland Museum of Natural History</a>. In technical terms, we’re actually the proud 
      adoptive parents of these two North American River Otters, and we couldn’t be more excited!  
  </p>

      Linus and Lucy are pretty darn cute, and the Museum sent us a packet of information about them. Read on, and get to know our new Otter Mascots!

        "Lucy was born in captivity in 1998 at an Otter Habitat and Rehabilitation Center in Pennsylvania. She was a program animal there for three years and after she 
       "retired" as a program animal she needed a place to live out the remainder of her life. Since she would not be capable of surviving in the wild, she was 
        transferred to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in 2003. She is currently on exhibit in the <a href="https://www.cmnh.org/nature-wildlife/wildlife">
        Perkins Wildlife Center</a>."

    <p>
        "Linus was a wild caught otter from Louisiana that came to the Museum as an adult in 2009. In Louisiana, and many other states, it is legal to trap and sell 
        otters for their fur. Linus was caught in such a trap and is now missing two of his digits on his front paw. The Cleveland Museum of Natural History rescued 
        him from being sold into the fur trade and he will live out the remainder of his life on display in the <a href="https://www.cmnh.org/nature-wildlife/wildlife">
        Perkins Wildlife Center</a>."

        Bonus Fun Facts:
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">
                North American River Otters are built for swimming. They have an excellent cardiovascular and respiratory system that allows them to stay under water 
                for up to 4 minutes at a time. They have a thick, waterproof layer of skin under two layers of fur to help keep them warm in all seasons. In addition, 
                they can close their ears and nostrils to keep water out and have a clear third eyelid called a nictitating membrane that protects their eyes while 
                under water.
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">
                Their whiskers are used to detect vibrations and movement in the environment. This helps river otters detect and hunt prey under water.
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">
                Although North American River Otters are very adapted to life in water, they actually spend two-thirds of their time on land.
            </li>
        </ul>
