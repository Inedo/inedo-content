    <h1>DevOps: From Best Practice to Industry Standard</h1>
    <p>
        Trends in the IT world are no different than any other industry; some come and go in the blink of eye, 
        while others hang around a bit longer. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        I recently read a great post by <a href="https://twitter.com/barry_crist">Barry Crist</a> over at Chef, who outlines 7 trends he sees taking the IT world by storm, and pushing DevOps from a best practice to the industry standard:
    </p>

	<ol>
        <li>The Job of IT will Change From Infrastructure to Innovation</li>
        <li>Continuous Deliver will become Ubiquitous</li>
        <li>The Public Cloud will Triumph in the Enterprise</li>
        <li>We will Enter a New Era of System Administration </li>
        <li>Peace Will Break Out Between Developers &amp; Security / Compliance Officers</li>
        <li>Executives Will Move Into the DevOps Tent</li>
        <li>Container Technology Will Be Improved &amp; Grow Even More</li>
    </ol>
	
    <p>
        The sixth point Barry makes is one we’re seeing more and more. DevOps isn’t just about development and operations, but really everyone in the enterprise.
        It’s about breaking down those silos, increasing the communications, and getting everyone involved. 
    </p>

        His observations are compelling and insightful, and I encourage everyone to check out the full article <a href="https://chef.io/blog/2016/02/09/devops-mainstream-2016/">here</a>!
