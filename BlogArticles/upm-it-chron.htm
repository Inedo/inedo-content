        I cover what a Universal Package Manager is, why they matter, and how they further the technical and cultural goals of DevOps. I also follow up with the important features to look for when choosing a Universal Package Manager, such as User restrictions, meta-data retention, license filtering, vulnerability scanning, and more! You'll just have to read the article to find out the rest.
