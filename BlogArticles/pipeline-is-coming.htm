    <h1>Check us out at Pipeline 2016!</h1>
   
    <p>
        As some of you may know, <a href="http://web.pipelineconf.info/">Pipeline 2016</a> is fast approaching. For those of you not in the loop, Pipeline 2016 takes place in London on March 23. 
        They’re self-described as, “a one-day not-for-profit 'unconference' event focused on Continuous Delivery.”

        We’re a huge fan of the conference and since we wanted to participate,
        we decided to join the elite list of <a href="http://web.pipelineconf.info/sponsorship/">Pipeline Sponsors</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only does the <a href="http://web.pipelineconf.info/2016/01/12/pipeline-2016-speakers/">Speaker Lineup</a> look fantastic this year, but <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble">Jez Humble</a> 
         is the keynote speaker, do you all <a href="#jez-humble">remember</a> his awesome Release face card!? With the other topics ranging from “<i>Changing a Culture to a Culture of Change</i>” 
        to “<i>How to Deal with a Hot Potato</i>” it could go without saying that we’re pretty psyched about this year’s conference.
