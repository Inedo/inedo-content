  <title>Webinar Announcement: Technical Preview of Romp</title>
 
</head>
<body>
  <p>We're launching a new product, Romp, and we'd like to invite you to our technical preview webinar.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/1319125166318178050">Join us</a> on Thursday, August 24th, at 4:00 PM EST. Seats are limited, so sign up today to reserve your spot. </strong></p>

<p><a href="/Romp">Romp</a> helps developers package application components together with infrastructure configuration, thereby keeping machine configuration code, application code, and deployment code in lock-step, in the same version control repository. Operations can easily inspect these packages, and then deploy them in a simple, but controlled manner.</p>

<p>Romp&#39;s powerful CLI embeds Inedo&#39;s advanced execution engine, and interacts with <a href="/support/documentation/proget/feed-types/universal">Universal Feeds</a> to build and deploy Romp packages, all while using open specifications that allow other tools to easily interact with Romp, and leverage it as part of your DevOps toolchain.</p>

<p>Inedo Founder, and CEO, <a href="/company/ceo">Alex Papadimoulis</a>, will present the preview of Romp, guide you through the problem space, and Demo Romp. If you're unable to attend, still register, as we will send out a recording a few days later.</p>
