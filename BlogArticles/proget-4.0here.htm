    <title>ProGet 4.0 is Here - Universal Packages, Feeds, and more!</title>

</head>
<body>
    <h1>ProGet v4 is Here!</h1>
    <p>
        We just shipped <a href="http://inedo.com/proget/4.0">ProGet 4.0</a>. It’s a major release of ProGet that’s all about universal usability.
        We've done a major redesign of the user interface and added <a href="http://inedo.com/support/documentation/proget/feed-types/universal">Universal Feeds and Packages</a>.
    </p>


    <h2>A Whole New Look</h2>
    <p>
        The most noticeable change is ProGet’s completely revamped Interface. We updated the UI to incorporate a clean, modern design; you can easily navigate to your Feeds, Packages and Connectors from any page.
    </p>

    <div class="clear"> </div>

    <div class="screenshot">

    <h2>Introducing Universal Feeds and Packages </h2>

    <p>
        Super simple package management that's <em> actually</em> meant for your applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="http://inedo.com/support/documentation/proget/feed-types/universal">Universal Feeds and Packages</a> give you all the same value and control of packages managers for your applications.
        They can be easily extended to serve for more specific package needs, giving you the ability to manage your applications as simple as you develop them.
    </p>

    <h2>...And More!</h2>
