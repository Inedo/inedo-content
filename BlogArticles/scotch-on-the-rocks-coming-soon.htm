    <h1 style="padding: 20px 0; text-align: center;">Join me in London for a drink and to chat about the Art of Software </h1>
   <p>
       I wanted to invite you to the next <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-Software-on-the-Rocks/events/237616821/">London Software on the Rocks meetup</a>. I thought it was high time for another 
       intersection of technology and drinking, known as <strong>Software on the Rocks</strong> (or, perhaps in a pint glass?).
   </p>
    <p>
        Join me at The Counting House on Thursday, February 16 at 7:00pm for a fairly casual meet-up, and a chance to mingle with developers 
        from all walks of life in London (and a couple from the states), discuss what makes software terrible (or awesome), trade war stories, 
        and enjoy some great beverages. Software practitioners of all types welcome!
    </p>

    <p>
        I'd still like to meet or catch up, I'll be traveling a lot this year and I have always felt that face-to-face time is still the best way 
        to get some insights for improving our software. If you have thoughts on any of our products, don't hesitate to reach out. There is a good 
        chance I might be coming to your area in the near future and we can set aside some time to chat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cheers!
