    <h1 style="padding: 20px 0; text-align: center;">The DevOps Handbook</h1>
   
    <p>
        Just in case you missed it, towards the end of last year Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, and John Willis published a book on 
        DevOps, and with that author list it should be at the top of your reading list!
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002">The DevOps Handbook</a> covers 
        some of the most common misunderstandings associated with DevOps. Just of few of the myths it tackles are:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong></strong><ul>
            <li><i>DevOps is for Startups Only</i></li>
            <li><i>DevOps is only for Open Source Software</i></li>
            <li><i>DevOps is Incompatible with Information Security and Compliance</i></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re super happy that this book is out since a lot of the topics they cover are the very things that sometimes prevent an 
        organization from even trying a move to a more DevOps culture.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of our favorite features of the book are the success stories demonstrating the way some organizations implemented DevOps best 
        practices. We’re a big believer in the power of success stories to help illuminate what’s possible by effecting a DevOps culture. 
        We’re also not too humble about <a href="/case-studies/buildmaster">publishing some of our own</a>!
    </p>

        If <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002">The DevOps Handbook</a> wasn’t on your reading list already it should be!
