    <p> 
        DevOpsDays Tokyo 2017 took place on Tuesday, Apr 25, 2017 and was a huge success! The event went so well that we have already started thinking about next year.

    <p>
        We were extremely excited to be involved by not only sponsoring and organizing this event, but also having Inedo's Founder and CEO, Alex Papadimoulis, speak. Alex and <a href="https://twitter.com/sandayuu">Tsuyoshi Ushio</a> gave the opening keynote address to kick things off, and later Alex gave another 45 minute talk on <i>DevOps for Japan</i>.

        We enjoy seeing Inedo community members at events like this, and hearing them share their experiences in the DevOps world. We'd like to give a special shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/@borrrden">Jim Borden</a>, who gave a wonderful talk on <i>Optimizing Deploy Pipelines with ProGet</i>. Thanks for highlighting ProGet Jim! 
    </p>
<p>
    We're happy to be a part of the growing DevOps movement in Japan, and this event provided an exciting forum for the IT community to discuss and share challenges, successes, and best practices for making culture changes, and adopting DevOps tools within Japanese organizations.
