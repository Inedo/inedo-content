  <h1 style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>The Best DevOps Tools BuildMaster Integrates With + SDK </strong></h1>

  <p>Many organizations are afraid of integrating DevOps automation because they don't want to disturb the processes that are already in place. The fear of a long transition period and resistance to change within the organization causes companies to continue using suboptimal deployment processes. Inedo's BuildMaster combats this fear by integrating with tools you are already using.</p>
  <p>Here are a few examples of how BuildMaster integrates with some of the most popular DevOps tools currently out there.</p>

  <h2>CI Tools</h2>
  <p>Continuous integration is the practice of merging all working developers' copies of a build to a shared mainline. Continuous integration tools automate the build and merge process. There are many benefits of CI tools such as immediate feedback, increased transparency, and early identification and resolution of issues.</p>

  <p>Jenkins and TeamCity are CI tools that integrate with BuildMaster. While these tools are great for automating builds, they aren't necessarily as good for automating the release. With both these tools, Buildmaster allows you to import build artifacts, apply the necessary approvals, conduct additional testing, and deploy the build to production. Software is built through the CI tool and released through BuildMaster using customized pipelines.</p>

  <h2>Cloud Services Platforms</h2>
  <p>Cloud computing is the process of storing, managing, and processing data on remote servers rather than local servers. Using the cloud allows resources to be shared and provisions to happen rapidly.</p>

  <p>Amazon Web Services and Windows Azure are both cloud services platforms that can be integrated with BuildMaster. This integration allows BuildMaster to communicate with the cloud service in order to deploy software into the cloud rather than on a local server.</p>

  <h2>Issue Tracking Tools</h2>
  <p>Issue tracking tools help identify and track issues throughout the entire deployment process until it is resolved.</p>

  <p>BuildMaster is able to integrate with Jira Software, TFS, and YouTrack. Integration with these tools allows you to track issues and ensure deployment only occurs after the issues are resolved.</p>

  <h2>Version Control Tools and Repository Hosting Tools</h2>
  <p>Repository hosting services allow large amounts of code to be stored on the web, either publicly or privately. They are often used for open-source projects.</p>

  <p>Version control tools is a way to keep software systems with various versions and configurations organized.</p>
  <p>GitLab and GitHub are version control and repository hosting tools that can be integrated with BuildMaster. When integration occurs, these tools become source control (tracking and managing changes to code) and issue-tracking tools. GitLab will be integrated into the release automation process, allowing issues to be identified and fixed before the deployment moves forward.</p>

  <h2>SDK</h2>
  <p>If we don't integrate with something you need, do not worry! You can write an extension that will best fit your needs using <a href="/support/documentation/inedosdk/extending/creating" target="_blank">SDK</a>.
