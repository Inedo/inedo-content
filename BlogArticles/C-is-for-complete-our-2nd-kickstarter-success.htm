    <h1>C is for Complete: Our second Kickstarter success</h1>
    <p>
        For the second year in a row, we had an exciting summer thanks to another successful Kickstarter. This year’s project was <a href="/abc">Programming Languages ABC++</a>. An alphabet book all about programming.

        As our Kickstarter and preorder fulfillment comes to a close, we wanted to take the time to say thanks to all of our backers and pre-orders, and the wonderful authors and team that made the book a reality. Plus, we had to share these adorable pictures of these very short programming enthusiasts. They may not be at a keyboard just yet, but we think they show some promise.

        If you liked the book, or even just the idea of getting kids excited about programming, keep an eye on this blog. We still have plenty of plans for the book in the near future. Also, if you missed the preorder stage, no worries, you can always pick up a copy of <a href="/abc/buy">the book</a>, or the extras through our site, or amazon.
