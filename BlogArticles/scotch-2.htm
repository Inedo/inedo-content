  <h1>Scotch of the Month: New Additions</h1>
  <p>
      February has officially kicked off, and with the news that Punxsutawney Phil the groundhog has seen his shadow, we're feeling a little down. 
      So with six more weeks of winter on the way, what better way to raise spirits than with some new additions to the 
      <a href="/company/scotch">Scotch Library</a>! As well as a long overdue update on our new space.
  </p>
    <p>
        As some of you may know, we moved into a new office at the beginning of 2016, and have since been making it our own. One of our
        most exciting new features of the office is in our entryway, a floor-to-ceiling scotch bar we had custom made for the space.

    <p>
        Here's a view of the entire bar.

    <p>
        We would love to have you come see it in person! As always, feel free to drop us a line, and share a dram with us.
    </p>
  <p>
      So on to the additions! First up we have <a href="http://www.nikka.com/">Nikka Coffey Grain Whiskey</a>. A Japanese Whisky, produced mainly from corn using one of their 
      continuous Coffey Stills. The Coffey Still produces a complex Whisky with a mellow and sweet taste originating from the grain itself. With Alex spending a 
      great deal of time in Japan as of late, working with our partner company, <a href="http://astah.net/">Astah</a>, we thought it
      was time to add another great Japanese Whisky to our ever expanding collection.
  </p>
  <p>
      Next, from a new distillery right here in Northeast Ohio, <a href="http://www.tomsfoolery.com/">Tom's Foolery Ohio Straight
      Bourbon Whiskey</a>. Back in 2014 they moved onto a large farm with a ton of acreage, and we can't wait to visit their tasting 
      room so we can get our hands on some of their other whiskeys, like Applejack, Rye, and more! They also recently released a Bonded 
      Bourbon, with more Bonded options on the way, and we're dying to try them all.

    <p>
        We also picked up two Speysides, <a href="http://craigellachie.com/">Craigellachie, aged 13 years</a>, and
        <a href="http://www.tamdhu.com/">Tamdhu, aged 10 years</a>. As our <a href="/blog/scotch-of-the-month-the-first-of-many">
        favorite scotch</a> is a Speyside, we are always eager to add more.
    </p>
    <p>
        We look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to add to our collection!
