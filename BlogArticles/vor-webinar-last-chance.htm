    <h1 style="padding: 20px 0;">Today is the last day to sign up for our webinar with Ken Duck!</h1>
    <p>
        Ken is covering just how common vulnerabilities are, how to use Vör Security and ProGet together to ensure your components are free of 
        known vulnerabilities, and how to assess them quickly when they are found.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because your Universal Package Manager is such a vital link in your DevOps Toolchain, it's important to ensure the packages
        you are using don't have any known vulnerabilities associated with them.
