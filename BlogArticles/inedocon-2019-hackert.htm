<h1>Jeff Hackert knows about Change!</h1>

<p>He'll be sharing his knowledge with you at <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/">InedoCon 2019</a>, May 22-23 in Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>As a self-described 'agent of Change' Jeff has been in the thick of Change over the last 2 decades. His expertise in: development culture, software methodologies, tooling, and the buzzwords that go with them is immense.</p>
