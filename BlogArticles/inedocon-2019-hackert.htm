<p>Former Director of Engineering at Chef, VP of Engineering at Soylent, and Partner at SuperGroup, Jeff has been implementing Changes at the highest levels. His expertise in: Development Culture, Software Methodologies, Tooling, and the Buzzwords that go with them is immense.</p>
<p>He'll be sharing his knowledge with you at <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/">InedoCon 2019</a>, May 22-23 in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>In his session "Is DevOps still a thing" <a href="https://confengine.com/user/jeffery-hackert">Jeff will cover</a>: past trends &amp; which of them have proven worth holding onto, common stumbling blocks &amp; how to avoid them, and how to benefit from Change.</p>
