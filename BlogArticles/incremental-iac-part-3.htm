    <h1>Part Three | Making Automation a Reality</h1>

    <p>
        It's time to take everything you've learned and bring your DevOps Toolchain into the modern era.
    </p>

    <p>
        The line between the proof-of-concept and the pilot can be blurry, but the phase generally shifts once the selected server's
        infrastructure is actually automated, and out in the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pilot phase can be thought of as the "new normal" for this particular server. Everything has checked out, and
        the benefits weren't outweighed by tremendous costs. Thus, by all accounts, it makes perfect sense to continue using your
        newly minted DevOps process.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, the new process is official: it's time to license the tools appropriately and train your staff appropriately on their new
        tasks and responsibilities. The only non-routine activity is to continually monitor and validate that the new solution is
        being well-received by all involved. And of course, share your stories of success with other groups within the enterprise.
    </p>

    <h4 style="text-align: center"><br /><i>1-2 years</i><br /></h4>
    <p>
        In just a few months, the results of the pilot will be very real, measurable, and notable: the ease of configuration change, time saved,
        fewer headaches, etc. will all be reportable and transparent for other groups. And not just that, your business will start to see how
        much easier it is to automate changes faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        From here, it's back to the first stage: select another server. With all the experiences and lessons you've learned implementing the
        process, each stage of the next iteration will be significantly easier, both technically and culturally. At some point, perhaps even
        after the first iteration, it'll seem almost trivial to transition several servers to Infrastructure as Code in parallel.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h4>
        Although this incremental process may take years, the results will be nothing short of transformative:
        your organization will have gained the knowledge and experience to not just implement DevOps, but to
        change and improve organizational processes. This experience will become invaluable when moving
        onto new servers, especially when these new servers don't even come close to fitting in the same mold as the other servers.
    </h4>
    <br />
    <h4>
        Remember, there is no end point of DevOps. It will continue to evolve as will how your organization
        addresses it. For now, just take what you have learned and apply it to other servers with an open, experimental mentality.
