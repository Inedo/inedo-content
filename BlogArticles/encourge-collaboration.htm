  <title>Encouraging Collaboration in the Workplace</title>
  
</head>
<body>
    <h1 style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Make your company a cool place to work.</h1>
   
    <p>
        Workplace collaboration is one of the most important characteristics of a successful company, but also one of the hardest to achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this digital age, face-to-face collaboration is often seen as an afterthought. However, the benefits of a truly collaborative 
        work environment shouldn't be underestimated. In a collaborative office, team members are not only more creative, but they feel 
        listened to, and appreciated. Collaboration also makes individuals more willing to ask others for insights, and offer their own 
        on multiple projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter how well a company is doing, the benefits of building a collaborative environment pay big dividends for 
        long term improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
        While there are many different ways to strengthen collaboration through 
        <a href="/blog/dice-breakers-using-devops-principles-and-nerdery-to-reimagine-team-building">team building exercises</a>, 
        the tech community is fortunate to have an additional, widely used option, (which we also think, happens to be more fun), 
        we have hackathons!
    </p>
    <p>
        A hackathon is an event where programmers, engineers, developers, designers, and anybody else who's interested, come 
        together to collaboratively propose, and create solutions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These events allow socialization between different sections of the company, and nationwide hackathons allow individuals 
        from around the country, who normally wouldn't have a chance to work together, to meet and create collaboratively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often times hackathons don't have a set problem to solve, rather, they allow teams to decide what they think are issues 
        within a company, and then propose ways to solve them. Attendees are broken into teams, and individual teams decide which 
        issue to focus on, and then work towards a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        These events are a great way to encourage your employees to take a break from their normal daily tasks, and use their 
        creativity and problem solving skills in a new manner. While much of the enjoyment from hackathons comes from the feeling 
        of community, and the social aspect of the event, employees often feel rejuvenated by solving problems that interest
         and impact them directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Knowing the benefits of hackathons, we here at Inedo are quite happy to sponsor them from time to time. Not too long ago the 
        2016 ROCKathon hackathon event was held at Wolters Kluwer Financial Services in St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Inedo was happy to be 
        a part of it! The staff was energized, and was able to come up with great software solutions and ideas in the two-day event.

        All in all, more collaboration is something most workplaces would benefit from. By encouraging a more open, welcoming, and 
        creative work environment, you will see team members creating and delivering more thought out, and better results.
    </p>
    <p>
        While there may be more mundane ways to foster better cooperation and collaboration, hackathons have proven track record in 
        the tech community. They can also be great fun!
