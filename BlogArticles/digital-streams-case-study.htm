    <h4>Digital Stream's Challenge:</h4>

    <p>
        Digital Stream has many applications to deploy. Through their proprietary central CMS system they customize websites for their individual clients. 
        Each clients website is its own application, adding up to approximately 250 applications that need changes and updates to accommodate the ever-evolving 
        world of digital media.
    </p>
    <p>
        Manually deploying this number of applications was incredibly time-consuming, and thus began their search for automation facilities. 
        After a quick search for competitive tools, BuildMaster organically jumped out as the best fit, and its quality was corroborated with 
        a recommendation from fellow BuildMaster user, <a href="/case-studies/buildmaster/rezare">Rezare</a>, friendly colleagues in the growing New Zealand tech community.
