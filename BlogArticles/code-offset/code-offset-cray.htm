        If <a href="/blog/code-offsets-who-is-charles-babbage">Babbage</a> is the father of computing, Cray is the father of <i>supercomputing</i>. His designs not only created the fastest computers of his time, but redefined what a computer could actually be used for. At the time, most of his competition focused on increasing processor speed, whereas Cray took a broader approach by pushing all elements of his computers to function faster.

        Pictured on the back of the 50 LOC Code Offset Bill, the Cray 1 was one of the most successful supercomputers ever built.  Additionally, we hold it as one of the damn coolest looking computers ever.
