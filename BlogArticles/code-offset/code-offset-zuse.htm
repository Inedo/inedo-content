    <p>
        Drawing heavily on <a href="/blog/code-offsets-who-is-alan-turing">Turing's</a> work, Konrad Zuse invented and built the world’s first programmable computer, The Turing-complete Z3. 
        One of it’s ancestors, the Z4, became the first commercially available computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regrettably, much of Zuse’s initial work was done amidst the backdrop of Germany in World War II. While Zuse was never formally associated with the less desirable elements of that time 
        and place, he did receive government funding. And, as a result, there was definitely a shadow cast over his work which resulted in much of his work going unnoticed by his contemporaries for years.
