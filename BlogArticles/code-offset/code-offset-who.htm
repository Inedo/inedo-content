  <h1>The Faces behind Inedo's Code Offsets</h1>
  <p>
      When we first thought of relaunching <a href="/offset">Code Offsets</a>, the idea of choosing important figures from the history of programming and computing seemed 
      like a fairly straightforward task. As it turned out, there were a few more twists and turns than anticipated.
  </p>
    <p>
        Do I just use programmers?  What about the engineers of the first computers?  What about the mathematicians whose theories explained the very idea of computing?  
        What about the business people, politicians, teachers, scientists, and researchers who pushed those devices to their limits, and found new and effecting uses 
        for them? 
    </p>
    <img src="/blog/_images/code-offset/list-buried.jpg" />
    <p>
        Pretty quickly, I had a list long enough to make hundreds of different Code Offset bills. Paring it down was one of the most laborious parts of whole project. 
        Doubtlessly, we had to cut out one of your favorites, and we certainly had to drop a few of ours. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As that short list developed, we tried to memorialize the people we could most directly link with the development of modern programing and computing 
        as we could. To a person, they straddle the lines of the fields we mentioned above, mathematician engineers, scientist financiers, and even an Admiral programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
        There certainly will be more Code Offsets incoming, so if you have opinions, please let me know! Feel free to email me at 
        <a href="mailto:proach@inedo.com?Subject=Code%20Offset%20Idea" target="_top">proach@indeo.com</a>, and maybe 
        we can chat about the second editions of our Code Offsets.
    </p>
    <p>So follow along as we post our nine part series, and discover why we picked each person, as well as a few little tidbits of computing history!</p>

            Head on over to our <a href="/offset">Code Offset's website</a> to see why bad code is a problem, and what you can do to be part of the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Already aware of some bad code? Well take the plunge, and <a href="/offset/buy">purchase</a> a pack or two of Code Offset bills for the clumsy coders 
            in your life! They're more than just a novelty gift, they allow you to finally <i>do something</i> about bad code.
