    <p>
        Codd has, hands down, the best and most intense stare in all of computer science history. 
        He also looks a hell of a lot like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese">that guy</a> from Monty Python, but probably more importantly, 
        he was the creator of the relational model. A theory of data management, the relational model was used as the foundation for relational databases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working for IBM in the 60's and 70's, Codd experienced a lot of pushback on the implementation of his theories. To counter, Codd went directly to IBM’s customers, showed them the value of his approach, and
        in turn, those customer’s pressured IBM into ceding to Codd’s methodology.
