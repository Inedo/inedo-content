        Von Neumann’s contributions to the wonderful world of mathematics have spilled over into dozens of other areas.  His theories have directly directly and indirectly
        influenced studies in biology, geography, physics, economics, statistics, and (nearest and dearest to our hearts) computing.

    <p>
        He advanced the study in multiple ways, such as by inventing the Merge Sort Algorithm and hand-writing the 23-page long sorting program for the EDVAC.
        And not to forget his more esoteric work on artificial intelligence with Alan Turing. He even programmed the world's first self-replicating program,
        less happily known as, <i>the first computer virus</i>.
