        Babbage was a no-brainer for one of our Code Offset bills.
    </p>
    <p>
        A pioneer of computer science, Babbage is considered by many to be the "Father of the Computer".
        He spent over a decade designing the first programmable computer, "The Difference Engine." While he never actually built it, his plans detailing
        a fully mechanical computer were used as a starting point for more complex devices. The Difference Engine was eventually constructed many times over,
        the first of which is housed in the London Science Museum.  Built using the techniques and materials available in Babbage’s lifetime, it proves Babbage’s design to
        be fully functional. You can also get a glimpse of it on the back of the <br/>2 LOC, Code Offset bill.
