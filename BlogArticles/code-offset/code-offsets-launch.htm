  <h1>Inedo's Latest Project: <i>Code Offsets</i></h1>
  <p>
      We’ve put together our collective design efforts, mashed up with our obsession for nerdy things, and created something awesome for the Development community. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Though our last project, <a href="/abc">Programming Languages ABC++</a>, was meant for the kiddos in our lives, this next project is for those coworkers, friends and family, or even yourself, 
      who need a little reminder when some less than adequate code starts getting thrown around. Our solution, a quick pat on the back, and a few <a href="/offset">Code Offsets</a>.
  </p>
    <img src="/blog/_images/code-offset/what-code-offset.jpg" />
    <p>
        Besides constantly aspiring to create an entertaining way to poke fun at coworkers, we also wanted our next project to really benefit the Development community as a whole. 
        Through working with non-profit groups that help promote good code through education, and investing in open source projects, we finally came up with the concept of Code Offsets. 
        Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offset">carbon offsets</a>, which aim to <i>reduce emissions</i> of carbon dioxide/greenhouse gases to compensate, or offset emissions made elsewhere, 
        our Code Offsets are used to offset the bad code that already exists.
    </p>

    <p>
        So when you purchase a pack of Code Offsets, the proceeds go towards our <a href="#partner">partner organization</a>, a non-profit group that helps promote good code through education. 
        We’ve designed nine different bills, each offsetting a select amount of bad code. The bills available range from one line, all the way up to one thousand lines. 
        You know, for that one person who really made a mess of things. They feature some of the most notable characters from the history of computing, the founders of the discipline from 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Babbage</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Hopper</a>. 
        Let us know on <a href="https://twitter.com/inedo">twitter</a> which bill is your favorite, or who you would like to see on a bill in the future!
    </p>
    
    <p id="partner">
        We also especially want to thank our partner organization, <strong><a href="http://twenty.techcorps.org/">TECH CORPS</a>.</strong> They are an amazing nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring 
        K-12 students have equal access to technology programs, skills and resources that enhance early learning and prepare them for college and career.
