        While the mustache accounts for roughly 50% of why we selected Herman for the 5 LOC bill, there is no doubting his far-reaching effects on 
        computing and programming. As the inventor of the punched card tabulator, his designs dominated the world of data processing for the first half of the 20th century.

        The punched card, or the Hollerith Card, was a rather elegant design. Essentially, it was a card with holes punched out, and the presence 
        (or absence) of which represented data that could be processed semi-automatically.
