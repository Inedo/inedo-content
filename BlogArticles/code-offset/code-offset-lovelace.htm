    <p>
        Lovelace is commonly credited as the first computer programmer, owing to an algorithm she wrote for <a href="/blog/code-offsets-who-is-charles-babbage">Babbage's</a> Analytical Engine. 
        There is some controversy surrounding this claim, but while the title of first programmer may be in question, the fact that she was a significant part of
         Babbage’s work, and a pioneer of early theoretical computing, is unassailable.

        She was also a bit of a dilettante who dabbled in many fields of the day. Her interests included mathematics and physics, but also some other stranger pseudo sciences, like mesmerism, and phrenology.
