    <h4>
        <i>Faster, Better, and Free Software Delivery</i> 
    </h4>
    <p>Universal Packages can help! You can package your applications and components directly from the Visual Studio Extension or the Jenkins Plug-in, or using free and open-source tools including the Universal Package Explorer or the cross-platform UPack Command-line Interface.</p>
   <p>
       If you want to get started with UPack or just understand Universal Packages better, check out the training seminar we hosted in December, 2018:

    <h2>Why should you use Universal Packages?</h2>

    <p>
        Software packaging is immensely useful for deployment of software libraries, tooling, and more. There is a package system for almost every environment you could imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
        But how does this help you with environments that don't share a common packaging system?
    </p>
    <p>
        Our solution is to build Universal Packages that allow you to take your software wherever it is you need it to go.
