    <h1>Another great Code PaLOUsa</h1>
    <p>
        I just wanted to take a moment to say thanks for a good time at <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/" target="blank">CodePaLOUsa 2016</a>.

        For exhibitors, cons can sometimes be a grind, but good company, good talks, and good Kentucky food makes CodePaLOUsa a breeze.

        Personally, I also had a fantastic time giving my talk, <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/Sessions/288" target="blank">'Pinochle, Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Software Usability'</a> to a room chalked full of fantastic nerds. All I had to do was bribe them with <a href="http://inedo.com/release">Release</a> and <a href="htto://inedo.com/abc">ABC++</a>. Hope you all enjoyed it.
