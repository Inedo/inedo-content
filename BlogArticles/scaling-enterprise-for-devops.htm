    <h1>If you Build it They Will Come: Scaling the Enterprise for DevOps</h1>
    <p>
        Recently, our colleagues over at <a href="https://xebialabs.com/" target="_blank">XebiaLabs</a>, discussed in a webinar a few steps needed in order to scale the 
        enterprise for a successful DevOps adoption. We think they highlighted some very important steps, check them out: 
    </p>
    <p>    
        <ol>
            <li>Create a high performing DevOps environment</li>
            <li> Be proactive about security</li>
            <li> Build your DevOps team</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With the Inedo DevOps solution (<a href="/proget" target="_blank">ProGet</a>, <a href="/buildmaster" target="_blank">BuildMaster</a>, and <a href="/otter" target="_blank">Otter</a>) 
        we’ve seen many organizations dive headfirst into attacking some of these steps – often times with a huge consideration on security.
         Many of our compliance features are natively built into our tools, as security is a common concern among our users. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Increased automation, and scaling an enterprise, can sometimes cause compliance to be an afterthought. With our features like audit trials, 
        manual and automated approvals, and configuration drift remediation; it’s easy to ensure you’re compliance standards aren’t sacrificed 
        for you DevOps adoption.
