    <h1>Setting up a DevOps Structure</h1>
    
    <p>
        If you haven't seen it yet DZone recently published an article by Andy Cureton concerning the <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/the-best-team-structures-for-devops-success">structure of DevOps teams</a>. Andy presents a few team structures that he's seen work in the real world, and suggests the Platform Engineering model as one worthy of consideration for adoption.

        We've been lucky enough to work with hundreds of different teams as they implemented DevOps in a way that works best for them. While we can conclusively say that no two organizations will ever implement, or practice, DevOps in the exact same way, Andy's general structures are good to consider.

        We'd love to hear from our users about what structuring systems they've implemented when setting up a DevOps environment. <a href="https://inedo.com/contact">Drop us a note with your thoughts</a>.
