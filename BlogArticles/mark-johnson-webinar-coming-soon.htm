  <title>Webinar Announcement: Windows Infrastructure Configuration and Management with Otter</title>

    <p>
        Otter lets you quickly configure your entire server infrastructure, whether it’s local, virtual, or cloud-built. 
        Once you have defined that configuration, Otter keeps an eye on your servers and either automatically remediates drift, 
        or emails you any issues.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In this webinar, Mark Johnson will take you through a demo of Otters main capabilities, and follow up with a Q&amp;A session 
        to respond to any questions you have during the demo.
    </p>
    <p>
        This webinar is for anyone on a Windows development team who is interested in managing their servers with a mind for 
        DevOps best practices.

        Manually remediating drift across a large number of servers can be a daunting and time-consuming task. Instead of 
        adding more team members when the number of servers increases, the simplest solution is to eliminate the manual 
        workload all together, by implementing automation.

        As a Windows shop, finding a tool with native Windows support was step number one, which led them to Otter.
