    <h1>Check us out at Code PaLOUsa 2016!</h1>
    
    <p>
        The next exciting conference on our horizons is none other than <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/">Code PaLOUsa 2016</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Weâ€™re always psyched to attend, and this year is no different! The <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/Speakers">speakers</a> never disappoint with a diverse range of interesting and thought-provoking topics. 
        If your sitting there thinking, " But Chadd, I have no idea what Code PaLOUsa is all about?" Well don't worry, dust off all the debris from the rock you've been under, we've got you covered.
    </p>
    <p>
        Code PaLOUsa is self-described as "a multi-day software development conference designed to cover all aspects of software development regardless of technology stack. 
        The conference schedule features presentations from well-known professionals in the software development community. The conference also features exhibitor tables where 
        leading software development companies come to interact with attendees to show off their latest wares." Exciting, right?!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Not only are we attending this year, but we have an exhibitor table loaded up with some <a href="/company/swag">sweet sweet swag</a>, we're <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/Sponsors/Default.aspx">sponsoring</a> 
        the conference, and our esteemed front-end developer/game-designer-extraordinaire, <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/SpeakerDetails/3C80AF47-7621-42CF-B3CD-2A0BF7F1C8D8">Patrick Roach</a> is speaking!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you haven't witnessed Pat's User Experience talk in the past, be sure to make time for it this year. Going exclusively off the title, 
        "<a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/Sessions/288">Pinochle, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Software Usability</a>", how can you not be intrigued? Pat uses the guise of game design to advocate the importance of considering User Experience 
        while simultaneously worrying about the details of development and functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        So come check us out at our exhibitor table for some free swag (we're talking stickers!) and to learn more about the latest and greatest from Inedo. 
        Let us know on <a href="https://twitter.com/inedo">twitter</a> if you see us there, and how life changing Pat's talk was.
