  <h1>Monolith to Microservices while Maintaining Compliance-with Bob Vandehey of Alkami Technology</h1>
  <p>Do any of the following apply to you?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You work in a highly regulated industry</li>
    <li>You work on a monolith application that is slowing down your development</li>
    <li>You're interested in moving towards a microservice architecture</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If so, you <strong>NEED</strong> to hear from <a href="https://confengine.com/inedocon-2019/proposal/8785/using-proget-and-synchrofeed-to-drive-componentization-and-automation" target="_blank">Bob Vandehey</a>, Vice President and Chief Architect at Alkami
    Technology, at <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/" target="_blank">InedoCon 2019</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bob has been working in online banking applications for more than 20 years, and he knows what stands up to compliance standards and what doesn't.</li>
    <li>He managed a monolith until it became too unwieldly and slowed down the team's ability to release changes quickly.</li>
    <li>Bob has moved his team to a microservice based model that componentized their monolith by breaking it into packages to allow for CI/CD.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At his <a href="https://confengine.com/inedocon-2019/proposal/8785/using-proget-and-synchrofeed-to-drive-componentization-and-automation" target="_blank">InedoCon 2019 talk</a>, you'll learn firsthand how Bob's team has broken down their aging
    monolith into a componentized, miroservices-based application and created a CI/CD toolchain that puts packages and synchronization as the key concepts to deliver changes quickly and reliably.</p>
  <p>Check out Bob's short video for more details:</p>
