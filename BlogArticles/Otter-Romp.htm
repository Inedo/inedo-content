  <h1>Otter Milestone 1 (Romp): Passed!</h1>
  <p>
  A few months back, we mentioned that we were building a new infrastructure automation product called <strong>Otter</strong>. You gave some great feedback on the idea and validated that there was, in fact, a real
      gap in existing DevOps tooling for solving these kinds of problems.
  </p>

  <p>
   We've still got a ways to go, but we've reached our first major milestone: <em>technical preview</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <a href="https://inedo.com/otter">OtterPreview M1 ("Romp")</a> is now available for <a href="https://inedo.com/otter/download">download</a>; we also have <a href="https://inedo.com/otter/tech-preview">a quick tutorial</a>
      for how to use Romp, and our <a href="https://inedo.com/otter">launch roadmap</a> showing what's coming next.
