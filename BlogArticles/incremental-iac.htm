  <h1>Modernize your DevOps Toolchain by Implementing Infrastructure as Code</h1>
  <p>
      Whether you've happily jumped on the band wagon or not, DevOps is becoming the new standard. Not because it’s some disruptive revolution, but because 
      it’s an evolution that responds to the challenges of modern software development.
  </p>
  <p>
      In this article series I'll cover Infrastructure as Code, and how to adopt it following our incremental
      approach. We developed this approach to offer a sensible route for organizations to evolve towards DevOps.

  <p>
      Our incremental strategy is a six-step, cyclical approach that not only minimizes the risk and costs of adopting Infrastructure as Code, but will build the necessary 
      in-house skillet and momentum for larger and faster cycles. Each of our steps build upon the last, both in terms of investment and preparation, 
      as will each overall cycle.

    <p>
        The hours are realistic for many enterprises, but will vary widely depending on the culture and politics of your organization. 
        Meetings tend to consume the most hours, and these estimates assume you have a small implementation team (1-3 people) 
        interacting with your key server personnel (2-4 people).
    </p>
    <p>So follow along as we post our three part series to discover a well thought out approach to implement the latest DevOps addition; Infrastructure as Code</p>
