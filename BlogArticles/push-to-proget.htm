  <title>Introducing Push to ProGet, a Visual Studio Extension that streamlines your process</title>

    <p>
        A <a href="/proget/details#repository">Universal Package Manager</a> is a key link in a
        <a href="/products#the-toolchain">DevOps Toolchain</a>, and often the central hub for an organization's software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because it's so vital, it is important to ensure that your UPM is maintained and updated with the latest packages and build
        artifacts as they are created, adapted, and developed. The <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-1463233.PushtoProGet">Push to ProGet Visual Studio Extension</a> allows 
        you to maintain and update a Visual Studio Project feed right from the IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
        ProGet is a Universal Package Manager that allows you to host both in-house and third party packages, libraries, and applications 
        locally. Follow along with the <a href="/support/tutorials/proget/push-to-proget-from-visual-studio">Push to ProGet Visual Studio 
        Extension tutorial</a>, and learn how to push directly from Visual Studio, to a designated Universal ProGet feed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Set up is easy, simply download the Visual Studio Extension in the normal manner, and from the solution explorer, right click
        on the project, and select <i>Push to ProGet</i>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, fill out the information needed in the few dialog boxes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, confirm and push your package, and Visual Studio will build the chosen project, package everything together as a 
        Universal Feed Package, and push it to ProGet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thats it! Once packages are in ProGet, it's easy to import those packages to BuildMaster to be deployed as part of a 
        Release Package, or pulled to Otter to provision infrastructure.
