  <p>There are a lot of various problems that can arise with a manual application build deployment. But while everyone is aware of the potential problems, there is a lot to keep track of. However, not addressing them is a short-term fix that can end
    in costly deployment failures later on.</p>
  <p>Understanding the different ways a manual deployment can fail and how automation can combat these failures will help reduce the risk of them occurring. Read on to learn about the top five manual deployment failures and how they could have been
    avoided with automation.</p>

  <h2>Human Error</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately, humans are susceptible to making mistakes. Manual deployments require the time, knowledge, and responsibility of a few key participants. When humans oversee these large deployments, they can easily make mistakes such as missing
    an error in code, making changes directly on the server, or misreading a line of text.</p>

  <p>These seemingly simple mistakes can cause huge problems in deployments; such as causing systems to crash, causing unexpected breaks in other areas of the software, or causing builds being sent to the wrong environment. This causes frustrations
    and time-consuming fixes for the developers, as well as loss of productivity for other areas of the company. In addition, when software is not working due to a deployment failure, this can result in unhappy end-users of the software.</p>
  <p>DevOps tools allows you to automate the deployment process rather than rely on manual deployment. Automating the process reduces the risk of human error by making sure issues are resolved, Approval Gates have been completed, and the deployment
    environment is defined before the software is sent out to production. Humans will no longer have to catch small mistakes within a build because the tools will do this automatically; reducing the risk of deployment failures.</p>

  <h2>Lack of Communication and Approval</h2>
  <p>In manual deployments, a lack of communication can easily cause deployments to fail. When humans are responsible for tracking their work or obtaining necessarily authorization, there is a lot of room for error that these requirements will not
    be met. For example, if someone resolves an issue on the software without documenting the change, another developer could believe that the issue has not yet been fixed and attempt to make the fix themselves. While they are trying to resolve a
    non-existent issue, this could cause other parts of software to break during their attempts. Additionally, if there is no approval process in place, developers can easily deploy builds before they are ready to go out.</p>
  <p>A simple lack of communication or a miscommunication can lead to disastrous deploys. When a deployment fails, through a break or an early deployment without all requirements met, this can cause many people to be affected and shift their
    attention away from other work as they try to undo the damage.</p>
  <p>Introducing DevOps tools into the deployment process ensures that communication is a top priority. Rather than relying on humans to document their work or notify the necessary personnel, these requirements are integrated into the process. For
    example, before moving forward in a deployment, a developer is required to check a box in the build dashboard that they are the one who resolved a certain issue. This allows other developers to know that they no longer have to fix that issue and
    also will hold the original developer accountable for their work.</p>
  <p>Additionally, Approval Gates can be integrated into the deployment process so that builds cannot move forward without appropriate human approval. This reduces the risk of builds being released early or without authorization.</p>

  <h2>Deployment Break with No "Plan B"</h2>
  <p>Everyone's worst fear! A build that was supposed to succeed unexpectedly fails during the deployment. With the belief that this build was all set and ready-to-go, there was no plan B of what to do in this scenario. Developers are left
    scrambling to make a fix.</p>
    <img src="/blog/_images/post-conf/plan-b.png" />
  <p>When there is an unanticipated deployment break and no backup plan, developers are forced to let the deployment continue and try to fix the issues as they arise. This can be time-consuming, costly, and inefficient. Additionally, this is a
    high-pressure situation for developers who are trying to quickly send out fixes without causing problems in other software.</p>
  <p>Automating the deployment process using DevOps tools can help ensure that you always have a Plan B. No matter what happens during the deployment, developers will be able to quickly and easily roll back to a previously successful release of the
    build. This allows developers to fix any problems that occurred during deployment under less-pressure knowing that all software is still working from the previous successful release.</p>

  <h2>Lack of Compliance and Security Testing</h2>
  <p>Compliance and security are important parts of any organization. However, as discussed in our last blog post, these issues are often not a top priority until it's too late. In manual deployments, when there is a lot of work to be done, it
    is easy to check for security and compliance issues or have the security team be part of the process.</p>
  <p>Failure to take compliance and security issues seriously can result in a lot of issues for a company. From legal fines, to unhappy customers or users, to data breaches or leaks; security and compliance issues are too important to push to last
    minute.</p>
  <p>When using DevOps tools to automate deployment, compliance and security checks are a priority right from the beginning. By integrating DevOps tools with issue trackers, compliance and security issues are identified and followed throughout the
    entire deployment process. This means that a build will not deploy until all issues have been resolved; reducing the risk of compliance and security trouble.</p>

  <h2>No Testing Environment Before Production</h2>
  <p>Manual deployments can be tedious and time-consuming as it is; let alone when testing needs to be completed. In some cases, during manual deployments, builds will be sent to their production environment without being tested in order to save
    time. For example, a developer may feel very confident with their build and think It's ready for production, so they just send it out. However, if it hasn't been tested properly then this deployment could cause issues in other
    software or not actually meet the build requirements.</p>
    <img src="/blog/_images/post-conf/no-testing.png" />
  <p>Of course, testing is an extremely important part of the deployment process. In fact, it's so important that we have a future blog post all about the five stages of testing. When testing is not completed properly, there are a lot of
    consequences: unhappy end-users, builds that don't integrate well with other software, unmet functional and non-functional requirements. Going back to fix these can lead to time-consuming fixes that could have been avoided if tested.</p>
  <p>Automating the deployment process can ensure that all builds will be sent through multiple testing environments before production. This ensures that the build will meet all necessary requirements and integrate well with existing process before
    being deployed to the production environment. If a build fails of stage of testing, it will be sent back to the beginning until the build can successfully pass all tests. This decreases the time needed to fix issues and help make the deployment
    process more efficient.</p>

  <p>Companies are more and more frequently moving away from manual deployments in favor of automated deployments. Automated deployments save time, money, and frustrations by reducing human error and fully integrating all components of a deployment
    life cycle. Additionally, if a problem does manage to arise during deployment, automation allows you to easily roll back to a previously successful release at any time.</p>
