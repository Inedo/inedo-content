    <h1>Discover how Hedgehog can help your organization's transition to microservice-based applications</h1>
    
    <p>
        Moving from monolithic applications to microservice-based applications is a smart decision, but comes with its own set of challenges. Even though you're breaking down a giant complex problem into smaller, more manageable ones – that can be deployed without disrupting other services – the difficulty comes in the management of all these new independent pieces that need to be able to work together. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/support/documentation/proget/core-concepts/packages#package-format" target="_blank">Universal Packages</a> allow for these smaller, independent bundles of code to be created, tested, and reused in a uniform process for all microservices. In <a href="/hedgehog">Hedgehog</a> you define this uniform process so that each team can deploy their own services in a consistent manner, which allows you to manage the increased complexity while meeting your compliance needs.

    <p>
