        Students will learn why public package managers cannot be used for distributing internal packages or libraries. We will walk through the features available within ProGet, and build a first feed with ProGet. In the second half, students will work through several advanced level features of ProGet. Features include package promotion, retention policies, vulnerability assessment and testing, license filtering, multi-site feed replication, and multiple feeds.

            <p>
                Audience: Developers, Release Engineers, Ops, QA, Managers
            </p>
            <p>
                Students will learn about the pains of software deployments without automated tools. BuildMaster comes to the rescue by giving development teams an efficient system for implementing automated builds. In this lesson, you will walk through the fundamentals of using BuildMaster.
