    <h1>Asset Directories in ProGet 4.8 </h1>
    <p>
        Introducting <a href="/support/documentation/proget/core-concepts/asset-directories">Asset Directories</a> in ProGet,  in beta now!
    </p>
    <p>
       We know how important it is to always use the right tool for the right job. Packages, such as
ProGet's <a href="/support/documentation/proget/feed-types/universal">Universal Packages</a>, are great tools for storing self-contained versioned
artifacts, complete with rich metadata and dependency information. However, not
everything is a package, and sometimes a file is just a file. 
</p>
<p>With ProGet already being
used as a central-hub for development and application packages at many
enterprises, the addition of Asset Directories now gives users the ability to utilize all
the security features in ProGet for not only packages, but also arbitrary file storage.
    </p>
    <p>
        An Asset Directory in ProGet is simply a container for any number of files and/or directories. We've already received a ton of great feedback on this feature, which will be live shortly, but if you have any suggestions or thoughts, please <a href="/contact">let us know</a>! We'd love to hear from you.
    </p>
