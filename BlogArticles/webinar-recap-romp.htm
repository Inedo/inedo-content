  <h1>Webinar Recap: A Technical Preview of Romp </h1>

    <p>
        During our latest webinar, Inedo Founder and CEO Alex Papadimoulis, did an overview of our newest product Romp, followed by a demo. 
        </p>
    <p>
        Romp is designed to help developers package application components together with infrastructure configuration, thereby keeping machine configuration code, application code, and deployment code in lock-step in the same version control repository.
