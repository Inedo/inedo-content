    <p>        Introducing the next generation of ProGet, in <a href="/proget/5.0">beta now!</a> </p>
    <p>
       ProGet started as a simple private nuget server; however, it has since grown to support eight addtional feed types, and now has enterprise features like deployment records, multi-site replication, and license filtering. With this next generation of ProGet, we plan to extend it's functionality even further with new features, a new look, and the same reliable package management. 
    </p>
<p>
    In this beta release, we're introducing quite a few noticeable upgrades:
</p>
<p>
    The most eye-catching upgrade is ProGet's new modern design, including a new logo. Users will find this design clean and intuitive with <a href="/support/documentation/proget/core-concepts/compliance">Compliance</a> and <a href="/support/documentation/proget/core-concepts/containers">Containers</a> as separate concepts in the top navigation. This design more accurately reflects ProGet's evolving direction, and it's importance as part of an Enterprise DevOps toolchain. 
</p>
<p>
    Recently, we've seen an increase in <a href="/support/questions/6932">requests</a> <a href="/support/questions/4568">for a notifier</a> feature. When exploring how to add this functionality, we wanted to add something that wouldn't be limited to just an email notification. So we decided to add <a href="/support/documentation/proget/storage/webhooks">Webhooks</a> as one of our ProGet v5 features. Webhooks help you connect ProGet with other services; like deployment tools, chatbots, ITSM platforms, and more.
</p>
<p>
    As you probably know, NuGet historically has a lot of versioning quirks. For example, 1.0 and 1.0.0 are considered to be separate versions, which means you can have two packages with basically the same version number. Recently, Microsoft has been working to elimate these quirks, and are moving towards a well-defined versioning scheme (SemVer2).  However, many organizations rely on these quirks, which is why we had been reluctant to include them in ProGet. But beginning in ProGet 5.0, we're ready to introduce a <a href="/support/documentation/proget/feed-types/nuget">new NuGet feed type</a> that will support only SemVer 2 version numbers.
</p>

    <p>
        We've already received a ton of great feedback on these features already, but if you have any suggestions or feedback, please <a href="/contact">let us know</a>! We'd love to hear from you.
