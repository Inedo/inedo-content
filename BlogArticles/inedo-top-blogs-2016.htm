    <p>
        We were able to publish more blog posts in 2016 than in any of the years prior. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We featured all major and minor releases 
        for ProGet, BuildMaster, and Otter, as well as any specific features that we thought were notable, or had been requested by our users.
        We also highlighted new partnerships, the release of our latest special project, and more! Here are Inedo's top ten blog posts of 2016.
    </p>

    <h3>#10 <a href="/blog/dice-breakers-using-devops-principles-and-nerdery-to-reimagine-team-building">Dice Breakers: using DevOps principles and nerdery to re-imagine team building</a></h3>
    <p>
        DevOps principles demand strong communication between the members of your team. The tools, the methodologies, all need the right 
        environment to be applied in. So if you want to build a team that can really talk to each other, you need to step away from the 
        standardized techniques, and pick up some new tools...
    </p>

    <h3>#9 <a href="/blog/introducing-inedos-next-cool-project-for-the-development-community">Inedo's Latest Project: Code Offsets</a></h3>
    <p>
        Besides constantly aspiring to create an entertaining way to poke fun at coworkers, we also wanted our latest project to really 
        benefit the Development community as a whole. Through working with non-profit groups that help promote good code through education, 
        and investing in open source projects, we finally came up with the concept of Code Offsets. Like carbon offsets, which aim to reduce 
        emissions of carbon dioxide/greenhouse gases to compensate, or offset emissions made elsewhere, our Code Offsets are used to offset 
        the bad code that already exists...
    </p>

    <h3>#8 <a href="/blog/the-whos-who-of-code-offsets">The Faces behind Inedo's Code Offsets</a></h3>
    <p>
        When we first thought of relaunching Code Offsets, the idea of choosing important figures from the history of programming and 
        computing seemed like a fairly straightforward task. As it turned out, there were a few more twists and turns than anticipated.

    <h3>#7 <a href="/blog/comparing-deployment-automation--infrastructure-as-code">Deployment Automation vs. Infrastructure as Code</a></h3>
    <p>
        An intriguing article breaking down the specifics of comparing Deployment Automation tools to Infrastructure as Code tools.
        We bridge the gap with a clever metaphor involving Air Jordans vs. Tesla, and go on to explain how a side-by-side comparison 
        of the two doesn't quite cover what you need to know; even still, there's nothing wrong with having, and using, both tools.
    </p>

    <h3>#6 <a href="/blog/launch-of-dasa-devops-agile-skills-association">Launching DASA: DevOps Agile Skills Association</a></h3>
    <p>
        The DevOps Agile Skills Association (DASA), was established with the objective of building a Universal Qualification Program for DevOps.
        DASA is a non-profit organization that provides an open, global community for DevOps and Agile skills development. We’re excited to be
        one of the founding forerunners for this initiative, and hope to fuel the transition to DevOps by helping define DevOps roles,
        and the learning objectives for those roles...

    <h3>#5 <a href="/blog/devops-in-action-feed-replication-supporting-true-collaboration">DevOps in Action: Feed Replication supporting true collaboration</a></h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned in <span style="font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Multi-Site Feed Replication in Action</span>, multi-site 
        replication is the mirroring of feeds across multiple ProGet instances. Many of our ProGet Enterprise users have a scenario that 
        requires common components, yet their instances are in different geographic locations. Recently, one of our users described their 
        set up of replication, and how, although not geographically dispersed, they still found a huge benefit from implementing replication...
    </p>

    <h3>#4 <a href="/blog/multi-site-feed-replication-in-action">Multi-Site Feed Replication in Action</a></h3>
    <p>
        Software Package Managers (NuGet, Maven, Bower, npm, etc.) are an established concept, and many enterprises use Universal Package 
        Managers, like ProGet, to manage and coordinate how these packages are used in the software development process. Many enterprises 
        are global organizations that have separate functioning business units that require common packages; this is where multi-site feed 
        replication comes in...

    <h3>#3 <a href="/blog/how-to-finally-modernize-a-devops-toolchain-infrastructure-as-code">Modernize your DevOps Toolchain by Implementing Infrastructure as Code</a></h3>
    <p>
        Whether you've happily jumped on the band wagon or not, DevOps is becoming the new standard. Not because it's some disruptive 
        revolution, but because it's an evolution that responds to the challenges of modern software development. In this article series 
        we covered Infrastructure as Code, and how to adopt it following our incremental approach. We developed this approach to offer 
        a sensible route for organizations to evolve towards DevOps...

    <h3>#2 <a href="/blog/why-you-absolutely-need-a-private-repository-a-response-to-npmgate">Why you absolutely need a private repository: A response to #npmgate</a></h3>
    <p>
        Npm is primarily used as an open source package repository manager for Node.js. On one fateful Tuesday, an npm package author, 
        Azer Koçulu, decided to unpublish all of his modules. One of those modules, "left-pad" had over two million downloads a month, 
        and was depended upon by countless popular packages. As such, Azer's deletion crippled many developers' important applications 
        and caused thousands of project builds to fail...

    <h3>#1 <a href="/blog/giving-nuget-server-a-new-home">Giving NuGet Server a New Home!</a></h3>
    <p>
        Our tool ProGet started as a powerful NuGet server. From its inception, ProGet has always had strong enterprise support for .NET 
        development and, with the latest version, it's grown into a full-blow Universal Package Manager with more and more feed types such 
        as npm, bower, powershell, etc. For those of you familiar with ProGet you've likely hear of another, similar tool, NuGet Server...
