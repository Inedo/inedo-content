    <h1> BuildMaster 5.0 is Released!</h1>
  <p>
      We are excited to announce we’ve officially shipped <a href="/buildmaster/download"> BuildMaster 5.0</a>. 
      It’s a major release of BuildMaster that offers a completely revamped User Interface, a new execution engine and the introduction of Pipelines. 
  </p>
    <h1>
Introducing Pipelines as Code
    </h1>
    <p>
        In Version 5.0, we introduce the concept of “Pipelines as Code” giving users the ability to create and edit pipelines either visually in the UI or via the JSON editor. 
        Adding another layer visibility and making simple or complex changes effortless while maintaining consistency across every release.
    </p>

    <h1>
A Whole New Look
    </h1>
    <p>
        We’ve done a major redesign of the interface making it even more users friendly. 
        We updated the UI to incorporate the same clean, modern and intuitive design as our other tools, <a href="/otter">Otter</a> and <a href="/proget">ProGet</a>. 
        You can now easily visualize and navigate to your Releases, Applications, Pipelines, and Plans from any page.
    </p>
   
    <h1>
    PowerFul Execution Engine
    </h1>
    <p>
        As users of Otter already know, the new execution engine is extremely powerful and contains major improvements for usability including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Seamless transitions between text and visual editing modes</li>
        <li> Ability to call deployment plans as templates </li>
        <li> Tight PowerShell or Bash script integration</li>
        
    </ul>
