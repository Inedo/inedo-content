        Otter lets you quickly configure your entire server infrastructure, whether it’s local, virtual, or cloud-built.
        Once you have defined that configuration, Otter keeps an eye on your servers and either automatically remediates drift,
        or emails you any issues.

    <p>
        Also check out <a href="/case-studies/otter/sure-id">SureID's case study</a> for more information about how they use
        Otter. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Manually remediating drift across a large number of servers can be a daunting and time-consuming task. Instead of
        adding more team members when the number of servers increases, the simplest solution is to eliminate the manual
        workload all together, by implementing automation.

    <p>
        As a Windows shop, finding a tool with native Windows support was step number one, which led SureID to Otter.
