  <h1>Webinar Recap: A Technical Preview of Hedgehog</h1>

    <p>
        During our latest webinar, Inedo Founder and CEO Alex Papadimoulis, presented an overview of our newest tool, <a href="/hedgehog">Hedgehog</a>, followed by a demo. 
        </p>
    <p>
        Hedgehog is designed to provide a centralized, web-based dashboard, for deploying Romp packages, universal packages, and other kinds of application release packages. It combines the usability and simplicity of Romp, with added release management features like pipelines and server targeting.
