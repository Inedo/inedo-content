	<p>We've drawn a lot of attention, and subsequent customers from banks and other financial sector entities. Through one of our customers we got the chance to meet and work with Sycorr, who specialize in the financial sector (FinTech). Having the opportunity to work with them, we can tell you they are just excellent at what they do.</p>

	<p>I got to sit down with founder Jeremy Neuharth a while ago and pick his brain on FinTech, DevOps, and <a href="https://www.sycorr.com/">Sycorr</a>. I walked away with understanding why they are always at the top of their game.</p>

	<p><strong>Thanks for making the time today!</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Happy to, thanks for the offer.</p>

	<p><strong>We've heard some great things about you from some of your clients. What's the biggest thing you hope a client gets from your work with them?</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> One of the first things we talk about with any client is having the concept of having small wins. To use a sports analogy; first downs make touchdowns.</p>
	<div class="callout" style=" float:left;">
		...small incremental deliveries have more flexibility which helps mitigate risk.
		</div>

	<p>Unfortunately, it's all too often we have seen people be drawn into larger projects or deployments which increases risk on so many levels. Clients with small incremental deliveries have more flexibility which helps mitigate risk.</p>
	

	<p><strong>We have that same Incremental View, and I like that analogy.</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Thanks, feel free to use it!</p>

	<p>We also feel that we need to take something from an engagement, it's just as important for us to keep improving as well.</p>

	<p>We always ask ourselves after any job; "What did I learn from this engagement that I can apply to other clients?" Continually asking and answering that question can lead to a lot of great solutions, and by continually learning about how to help others better we increase our strengths and job satisfaction.</p>

	<p><strong>Speaking of job satisfaction... Why did you decide to focus on consulting rather than become an in-house dev some place?</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Really, we formed Sycorr in 2010 because consulting can be incredibly gratifying and it helps us to stay fresh and up-to-date.</p>

	<p>There is something about working with a variety of organizations that is alluring. New challenging problems being solved with a dash of past experience is extremely rewarding for us.</p>

	<p><strong>I think you've probably just given part of the answer, but why did you form a small company rather than join a large consulting firm?</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Simply put, we wanted to control who we work with, we wanted to work with extremely talented and passionate developers. When you have large teams, you have a few heroes, but when you have a small business &ndash; everyone needs to be excellent to survive.</p>

	<p>We created Sycorr to help banks and credit unions leverage technology in ways that the industry is not currently. Regulatory concerns has stifled innovation and we wanted to do something about that. We wanted to break through the red tape and use our abilities to show financial institutions how technology can be a true asset.</p>

	<p><strong>So focusing on the financial sector is obviously part of it, but do you have a speciality?</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Our clients would probably say we reduce operational overhead by focusing on automation of business problems.</p>

	<p>Due to the industry we typically serve, our team is sensitive to concepts around separation of concerns, limited downtime releases, logging/auditing, working with legacy systems, and automation of test labs.</p>

	<p><strong>If that's what your clients say, what do you say?</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Bringing our DevOps mentality and financial sector knowledge to the table helps our clients by removing the slow, error prone, and manual processes that are easily solved using proven tools.</p>

	<p>Yes, there are significant challenges because of regulations, and sensitive or protected data, but they are challenges that can be met and overcome. </p>

	<p><strong>It sounds like you're really passionate about this, any favorite success stories?</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Oh I love this simple story because it really shows the power of continuous builds and automated deployments.</p>

	<p>About Six months had passed since we wrapped up a project, and our build was still set-up to compile and run tests on a nightly schedule...</p>

	<p>One morning we came into the office and a test had failed, and digging into it we discovered a small bug that revolved around Daylight Saving Time. We fixed, tested, built, and deployed all before the client got into their office. They were blown away that we had found a problem and fixed it so quickly, professionally, and months after the project was done.</p>

	<p>To this day, they provide us great testimonies on quality. All because we had implemented a nightly testing schedule.</p>

	<p><strong>Great story! Since time changes only happen twice a year, what's something that you see much more commonly... in a bad way?</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Far too many manual processes that take too much time and cause inconsistent results. Just mapping the processes is often one of the first things we have to tackle.</p>

	<p><strong>Yeah, lack of consistent results of any kind isn't what you want to see! What's the most over-used buzz word you're coming across?</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Disruptive. Saying you are "disruptive" probably means you are entering into an established market with competitors larger than you are. You aren't going to beat them at their game; that's just silly.</p>

	<p>Innovate! Be so innovative that you change how people work, act, or think; that's shaking things up, that's how you achieve success!</p>

	<p><strong>Well you've obviously innovated the correct ways and have built a great team! Thanks for the chance to chat. I learned a lot!</strong></p>

	<p><span class="jeremy">Jeremy:</span> Thanks I had a lot of fun.</p>
