    <h1>Catching up with Chris Dunne from Daysha</h1>

	<p>
        Last time I was in Dublin, I shared a Guinness (or a few) with Chris Dunne from <a target="blank" href="http://www.dayshaconsulting.com/" >Daysha Consulting</a>, one
        of our <a href="https://inedo.com/services">Services &amp; Training</a> partners. Given his experiences in the DevOps community, I thought it'd be the perfect opportunity for another quick interview!
	</p>

	<p>
	<strong>
        Thanks for making the time today for a quick chat, it was great to finally get to meet you in person.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> You too!
	</p>

	<p>
	<strong>So how did you end up as a consultant for DevOps and agile practices?</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> : Well, I stared off my career in embedded systems, I decided to leave the hard-coded world to start my own company that made a software product for content management and web-applications. As I was working on that I had a bit of free time, and through serendipity was offered a consulting gig, and I’ve been doing it ever since. For about 10 years now actually
	</p>

	<p>
	<strong>
       With all that diverse experience, you stuck with consulting?</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> : It wasn’t something I had planned, or set out to do, I kinda stumbled into it. For me consulting has two sides: on one hand you’re educating the client, and on the other you’re getting project work done. I really liked the mix of the two. I wasn’t expecting that going in, but I really do enjoy that facet of the job.
	</p>
	<div class="callout" style=" float:right;">
	"On one hand you’re educating the client, and on the other you’re getting project work done..."
	</div>
	<p>
	<strong>
      With your past and experience I image there is a whole list of stuff you can help out with, what’s your speciality?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> Honestly, it’s DevOps. I know that’s a loaded term, but it really does encompass many of the aspects of the consulting I had been engaged in before the term even became known.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be a bit more specific I focus on tools consulting, and helping organizations make the most of the tools available to improve how they deliver software to market.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>
      Which is, of course, how we first got on each other’s radar. </strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> Indeed, I ran across <a href="https://inedo.com/buildmaster">BuildMaster</a> while working for a client.
	</p>

	<p>
	<strong>What is it you hope a client takes away after working with you?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> I hope that they have enjoyed working with us. This means that we have established a good relationship, and they don’t feel like they’ve been ripped off or have wasted time. But mostly, I hope we left the client in a better position than when we started.
	</p>


	<p>
	<strong>You work with a lot of big, multi-national clients, what are they asking for these days?</strong>
	</p>
	<div class="callout" style=" float:left;">
	"Lots of times in the software industry, companies move towards a new trend at break-neck speed"
	</div>
	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> Containerization seems to be the biggest conversation starter right now.
	</p>

	<p>
	<strong>Is that good or bad?</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> It’s not inherently bad, but I think there is too much hype and not enough true understanding of how containers fit into an overall enterprise architecture.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lots of times in the software industry, companies move towards a new trend at break-neck speed, for better or worse, and while that can have positive outcomes, it can also cause a lot of reinventing of the wheel and duplication of effort.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Sounds like you’ve seen this pattern before.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> It might sound a little cynical but I do see many organizations adopting new technologies for the sake of it, or at least without a good business reason. Just because something is new it’s not necessarily better, and new doesn’t always mean progress.
	</p>
	<p>
		I see this especially in the DevOps space where organizations feel pressured to adopt new practices and changes without really understanding what’s wrong with the old processes first.
	</p>

	<p>
	<strong>That must be frustrating.</strong>
	</p>
	<div class="callout" style=" float:right;">
	<img src="/blog/_images/becuase-we-can.png" />
	</div>
	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> Actually it can be really rewarding! Getting an organization to think about where they are before thinking about where they are going can really lead to exceptional outcomes.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>I know you follow a lot of different conference presenters, and speakers to stay up-to date, have you come across anything really great lately?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> This year’s Atlassian Fire-side chat, where Atlassian founders talked about their origins and culture. I think Atlassian is a brilliant model for software companies and we can learn a lot from them. It will be really interesting to see how their culture is tested and changed now that they have an IPO under their belt.
	</p>

	<p>
	<strong>Quick! What do you think is the most over-used buzz-word right now?</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> Docker
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>And... we’re right back to containers I see! So let’s wrap this up with one last question: if you could dictate one rule that every dev shop in the world had to follow, what would it be?</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> For all green-field projects, automate all testing from day one. Use TDD to help design better software.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Always a good rule. Thanks again for making the time Chris!</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="Dunne">Chris:</span> Happy to, this was fun.
	</p>
