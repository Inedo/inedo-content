  <h1>Taking down the Monolith with Kevin Griffin</h1>
  <p>Learning from passionate subject matter experts is a hallmark of the conference experience. Learning from <em>experienced</em> <em>training professionals</em> can take a normal conference session to the next level of accessibility and help
    provide a deeper understanding for attendees.</p>
  <p>Ensuring that we had great teachers, and not just speakers, at <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/">InedoCon 2019</a> was a requirement for us from the very beginning.</p>
  <p><a href="https://confengine.com/user/kevin-griffin">Kevin Griffin</a>, as owner of Swift Kick consulting, is not just a development expert but a gifted trainer that makes instruction a key part of his development process.</p>
  <p>Aside from leading the <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/certification">ProGet Certification Workshops</a> at InedoCon 2019, we're ecstatic that Kevin will also be leading a session: <a href="https://confengine.com/inedocon-2019/proposal/8844/taking-down-the-monolith-one-package-at-a-time">Taking Down a Monolith One Package at a Time</a>.</p>
  <p>Hear about his session in his own words in this short video:</p>

  <p>Kevin's experience as a consultant gives him a refreshing perspective as an outsider specializing in decoupling the parts of monolith applications to make them more stable and secure; while speeding up release cycles that are often
    measured in quarters.</p>
  <p>His experience with Health Care, Ticket Brokering, and Military codebases has given Kevin vast experience in seeing what large organizations do wrong, and how to fix it in a <em>maintainable way</em>!</p>
