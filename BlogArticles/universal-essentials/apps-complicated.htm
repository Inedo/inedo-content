    <p>
      Applications are really complicated beasts. Developers might make it look simple, but at its core, the simplest project is still super complicated and many organizations are making it even harder than it has to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dealing with internal and external dependencies, more often than not, many teams will just chuck their code into a single library and share it via something like a UNC path. This isn't a big deal if you're on a small team, but once you get over 2-3 people, this is not efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      As anyone who works with software knows, dependencies change. There are updates to the code all the time, and you really need a simple and reliable way to get those updates distributed&hellip; That's when we start talking about packages.
