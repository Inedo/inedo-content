    <p>The DevOps Agile Skills Association (DASA) is a non-profit organization that provides an open global community for DevOps and Agile Skills development. 
    We&rsquo;re excited to be a part of DASA as a forerunner, and we were delighted when Alex was asked to present.</p>

    <p>I'll often hear people say, &ldquo;DevOps is just a buzz word with no real meaning&rdquo; or &ldquo;Our Company can&rsquo;t do DevOps &ndash; We&rsquo;re not Netflix&rdquo; but the truth of the matter is that DevOps is no single tool, person, or job title.
     So what is it then? Well, that&rsquo;s what all the great folks involved with DASA are setting out to establish &ndash; a vendor neutral, community-driven, framework for DevOps.</p>

    <p>Alex&rsquo;s talk aims to shed light on breaking down some of the notions and assumptions about DevOps, and why you should <em>actually </em>care. 
    We live this message everyday here at Inedo, maintaining it through the three design tenets of <a href="/products">our tools</a>: visibility, ease of use, and user interface. As well as how we&rsquo;ve developed them 
    to seamlessly work well together, and with others. We know there&rsquo;s no singular DevOps tool, or one &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to implement DevOps, and we&rsquo;re excited to have Alex share his thoughts with everyone at this event.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s not too late to register for either global launch session!
