    <title>NuGet Essentials: A Free Virtual Seminar</title>

</head>

    <h1>Announcing a free NuGet seminar</h1>

    <p>
        We're excited to announce we'll be a hosting our first virtual training seminar, <a href="/training/upm-nuget">NuGet essentials</a>, which will take place Wednesday, November 29th at 1 p.m.
    </p>
    <p>
        This virtual seminar will cover the history, best practices, and uses cases for <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a>, the open-source .NET package manager. This seminar will be split into two sessions, and we've decided to make the <a href="https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/970291909971644931">first session</a> <b>free</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
        For this seminar, we want to mention our friends at <a href="https://www.myget.org/" target="_blank">MyGet</a>. Maarten Balliauw and Xavier Decoster are not only the creators behind the popular service MyGet, they also <em>literally</em> wrote the book on NuGet, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pro-NuGet-Experts-Voice-NET/dp/1430260017">Pro NuGet</a>; a book we've been recommending to folks for years to learn some of the ins-and-outs of NuGet. We’ll also be giving away a copy of Pro NuGet to a randomly selected attendee.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our Universal Package Manager, <a href="/proget">ProGet</a>, started as a NuGet package manager, so we understand the impact this framework has on organizations' development process. Even though NuGet has been around for more than half a decade, it's a fairly underutilized framework. With our ProGet users, we often see only one team or business unit utilizing NuGet, when the entire organization would benefit from expanding usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we began developing this seminar, we wanted to create training that would help developers of varying skill levels. We didn't want to exclude those who we're unfamiliar with NuGet, but we also didn't want it to be too basic as an "Intro to NuGet" training course for those already familiar. Because of this broad spectrum, and recognizing that many would benefit from a further, more refined, understanding of NuGet, we've decided to offer the first session of the seminar completely free of charge – making this an opportunity for all to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="/training/upm-nuget#lab">second session</a>, which will consist of hands-on, guided labs, led by an Inedo certified instructor, will cost $200 per person. This more in-depth session will give attendees the opportunity to leverage this new knowledge in a real-world example to increase confidence and proficiency in their day-to-day development. With guidance from our instructor, attendees will learn the proper way to create and consume packages, ensuring all team member are on the same page, and in turn will optimize the efficiency of your software development process. This hands-on session will last approximately an hour and a half.
