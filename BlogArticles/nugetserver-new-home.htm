        Giving NuGet Server a New Home!
    </h1>
    <p>
        As you may already know, our tool <a href="http://inedo.com/proget">ProGet</a> started as a powerful NuGet server. 
        From its inception, ProGet has always had strong enterprise support for .NET development and, with the latest version, it’s grown into a full-blown Universal Package Manager with more and more 
        feed type such as  npm, bower, maven, etc. For those of you familiar with ProGet you’ve likely heard of another, similar tool <a href="http://nugetserver.net/">NuGet Server.</a> 
    </p>
    <p>    
        NuGet Server isn’t exactly a competitor of ProGet, just like walking isn’t exactly a competitor to cars; it’s just a different way of getting to an end point. 
        NuGet Server is a quick and easy private NuGet server developed by entrepreneur/software consultant, <a href="http://thomasardal.com/">Thomas Ardal</a>. 
        Thomas is also the brain child behind SaaS application <a href="https://elmah.io/">elmah.io</a>. With the popularity and success of elmah.io growing, 
        Thomas wanted to focus his time and energy on it, but also wanted to make sure NuGet Server was in good hands - so we agreed to give it a new home.

        There will be a few changes, most notably the price; down to <b>only $9</b>!
        The proceeds will benefit <a href="http://inedo.com/offset#who">a great nonprofit group</a>, and we'll
        mail purchasers a free, <a href="http://inedo.com/offset#the-offsets">code offset bill</a> featuring Alan Turing that offsets
        up to ten lines of bad code!
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re all about supporting .NET packaging and development whether through a hosted service like <a href="http://myget.org/">MyGet</a>, a basic tool like NuGet Server, or a Universal package manager 
        like <a href="http://inedo.com/proget">ProGet</a> and <a href="http://jfrog.com/artifactory/">Artifactory</a>.
