  <h1>Scotch of the Month: Glenfiddich 12</h1>
  <p>
    As the Inedo "house" scotch, it was a unanimous decision to feature Glenfiddich 12 as the first Scotch of the Month.

    Glenfiddich 12 was the scotch that started it all for us. When our CEO &amp; Founder <a href="/about/ceo">Alex Papadimoulis</a> 
    brought it into the office one day to enjoy a drink or two, we didn't realize how influential its presence would be. 
    We now have over 10 different Glenfiddich bottles in <a href="/about/scotch">our scotch library</a>, and we are fond of all of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sipping on the classic Glenfiddich 12 is always a great way for us to wind down after a long day of answering support
    emails and <s>fixing bugs</s> writing software.

    Recently it helped rally company morale when our air conditioner decided to crap out on us for about a week.
    As much as we love sitting in the summer Cleveland heat dreading the upcoming winter, it wasn't exactly the ideal 
    office situation... but we definitely made the best of it! A cigar and the '12 paired quite nicely on those afternoons.

  <p>
    We've also used it to inspire critical brainstorming sessions for our upcoming new office space. Stay tuned as
    we will be writing all about the new space in an upcoming post!
