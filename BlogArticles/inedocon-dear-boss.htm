    <p><strong>Subject line:</strong> Please send me to InedoCon 2019: The Automation Journey for Enterprises</p>
    <p>
      Dear [Boss / Team],
    </p>
    <p>
      As we head into spring, I'd like to attend <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/">InedoCon 2019: The Automation Journey for Enterprises</a>, taking place May 22-23, 2019 in Portland, Oregon at the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/pdxpc-courtyard-portland-city-center/">Courtyard Portland City Center</a>. I'll be able to meet other sysadmins, architects and developers who are tackling similar DevOps challenges at their organizations.
    </p>

    <p>InedoCon is geared towards [insert role] at organizations like ours that are interested in best practices in software delivery, and need expertise and tools to scale automation, adopt microservice architecture and CI/CD, and build a software delivery process end-to-end.</p>

    <p>As a user of [ProGet and BuildMaster], tools that are central to our software development and delivery, my attendance at InedoCon will provide valuable training to help us achieve [fill in team goal] this year. I'll come away with both strategic direction and tactical advice to improve our existing workflows and get legacy systems under control.</p>

    <p><strong>A ticket to InedoCon includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>A full day of sessions covering continuous delivery, infrastructure automation, and packaging to help us implement a working CI/CD pipeline at our organization. Sessions include:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>A case study from WebMD on building a CI/CD platform across dozens of microservices and a legacy monolithic application with BuildMaster in play along the way.</li>
    <li>How Alkami uses ProGet to handle componentization, the move to microservices, and resulting explosion of growth in repos, build plans, packages and deployments.</li>
    <li>Strategic approaches to introducing automation in compliant-heavy industries, like government.</li>
    <li>How to leverage ProGet and BuildMaster to simplify applications and prove compliance.</li>
    <li>How you can add CI/CD to a legacy application through build, deployment, and process automation (from BuildMaster's product director himself)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>A day of <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/certification">certification workshops</a> valued at $2,500 led by InedoCon speakers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGFGemMSWNA&amp;t=1463s">Kevin Griffin</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SoCX6dwWPE&amp;list=PL28hfDz-KqT5T_An9B-oCtMs_oYbd4lLV">Mark Johnson</a>, and <a href="https://confengine.com/user/kendall-miller">Kendall Miller</a> on how to make the most of ProGet and BuildMaster, with an option to get on-site certification. I'll learn how to use the tools to automate builds, create a deployment pipeline, improve vulnerability assessment and testing, and make use of telemetry to enable self-support and centralized alerts/diagnostics.</li>
    <li>Meals, plus entrance to the event's networking reception.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cost for attending:</strong></p>

    <p>If I <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/inedocon-2019-tickets-53073547409">register by March 29</a>, the conference ticket is just $200. With travel and accommodations totaling [fill in cost], the all-in cost would be [total].</p>
      <p>
        Let me know if I'm approved to attend InedoCon. I hope you'll agree attending is a worthwhile investment for our company.
