  <p>Some of what you’ll learn from our sessions includes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>WebMD's</strong> Continuous Delivery Architect <a href="https://confengine.com/inedocon-2019/proposal/8594/the-enterprise-automation-journey">Aaron Jensen</a> will talk about how they successfully transitioned from a monolith application with no automation to a CI/CD platform with dozens of micro-services using BuildMaster.</li>
  <li><a href="https://confengine.com/inedocon-2019/proposal/8785/using-proget-and-synchrofeed-to-drive-componentization-and-automation">Robert Vandehey</a>, <strong>Alkami's</strong> Vice President and Chief Architect, will show how they componentized a monolith into packages for microservices using ProGet as the key link in their deployment chain.</li>
  <li>BuildMaster's product director <a href="https://confengine.com/inedocon-2019/proposal/9351/adding-cicd-to-a-legacy-application">John Rasch</a> will demonstrate how you can add CI/CD to a legacy application through build, deployment, and process automation.</li>
  <li>Governmental organizations and other compliant-heavy industries have specific challenges for automation. <a href="https://confengine.com/user/jody-dorchester">Jody Dorchester</a> will present how 100’s of applications were automated with BuildMaster in less than a year, while maintaining compliance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Of course that's just part of a packed two-day <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/schedule-23">schedule</a>. Besides learning from those who have already ‘been there’ attendees will have the opportunity to become <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/certification">certified in Inedo</a> products at the 101 and 201 level.  In the workshops you’ll learn how to use BuildMaster and ProGet tools to automate builds, create a deployment pipeline, improve vulnerability assessment and testing, and make use of telemetry to enable self-support and centralized alerts/diagnostics. InedoCon workshop content is sourced directly from Inedo’s usual onsite or remote product training and valued at $2500 per course for teams.</p>

    </p>

    <p>InedoCon is geared towards [insert role] at organizations like ours that are interested in best practices in software delivery, and need expertise and tools to scale automation, adopt microservice architecture and CI/CD, and build a software delivery process end-to-end.</p>

    <p>As a user of [ProGet and BuildMaster], tools that are central to our software development and delivery, my attendance at InedoCon will provide valuable training to help us achieve [fill in team goal] this year. I'll come away with both strategic direction and tactical advice to improve our existing workflows and get legacy systems under control.</p>

    <p><strong>A ticket to InedoCon includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>A full day of sessions covering continuous delivery, infrastructure automation, and packaging to help us implement a working CI/CD pipeline at our organization. Sessions include:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>A case study from WebMD on building a CI/CD platform across dozens of microservices and a legacy monolithic application with BuildMaster in play along the way.</li>
    <li>How Alkami uses ProGet to handle componentization, the move to microservices, and resulting explosion of growth in repos, build plans, packages and deployments.</li>
    <li>Strategic approaches to introducing automation in compliant-heavy industries, like government.</li>
    <li>How to leverage ProGet and BuildMaster to simplify applications and prove compliance.</li>
    <li>How you can add CI/CD to a legacy application through build, deployment, and process automation (from BuildMaster's product director himself)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>A day of <a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/certification">certification workshops</a> valued at $2,500 led by InedoCon speakers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGFGemMSWNA&amp;t=1463s">Kevin Griffin</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SoCX6dwWPE&amp;list=PL28hfDz-KqT5T_An9B-oCtMs_oYbd4lLV">Mark Johnson</a>, and <a href="https://confengine.com/user/kendall-miller">Kendall Miller</a> on how to make the most of ProGet and BuildMaster, with an option to get on-site certification. I'll learn how to use the tools to automate builds, create a deployment pipeline, improve vulnerability assessment and testing, and make use of telemetry to enable self-support and centralized alerts/diagnostics.</li>
    <li>Meals, plus entrance to the event's networking reception.</li>
