  <h1>Webinar Recap:  Provision your Servers and Manage Configuration</h1>

    <p>
        During our most recent webinar, Inedo Founder and CEO Alex Papadimoulis presented an Introduction of <a href="/otter">Otter</a> including a demo of <a href="/otter/2.0">Otter 2.0</a>.

        Otter helps you provision and configure your server automatically, without ever needing to log-in to a command prompt. You can define reusable sets of configuration called roles, and then scale your infrastructure by simply assigning these roles to any number of servers.
