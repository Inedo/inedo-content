        We wanted to thank all of our users for a wonderful year, and cheers to an incredible 2018! Here are the top blogs of 2017. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We featured all major and minor releases 
        for ProGet, BuildMaster, and Otter, as well as our technical previews, and beta releases of our three new additions to the Inedo Toolchain family, Romp, Hedgehog, and UPack. We highlighted specific upcoming features that we thought were notable or had been requested by users, announced new partnerships, and released and recorded 5 webinars, as well as a Free NuGet seminar! Here are Inedo's top ten blog posts of 2017.

    <h3>#10 <a href="/blog/3-new-buildmaster-features-now-in-beta">3 New BuildMaster Features now in Beta</a></h3>
    <p>
        Introducing Plan Versioning, Text Templating, and an updated LDAP and active directory integration, in beta now! Deployment plans are at the heart of BuildMaster's automation, and allow users to direct and structure their releases either visually, from a drag-and-drop editor, or from a text-based editor. Though this makes...

    <h3>#9 <a href="/blog/introducing-push-to-proget-a-visual-studio-extension-that-streamlines-your-process">Introducting Push to ProGet: a Visual Stuido Extension </a></h3>
    <p>
        A Universal Package Manager is a key link in a DevOps Toolchain, and often the central hub for an organization's software development. Because it's so vital, it is important to ensure that your UPM is maintained and updated with the latest packages and build artifacts as they are created, adapted, and developed. The Push to ProGet Visual Studio Extension allows....

    <h3>#8 <a href="/blog/developer-on-fire">Developer on Fire</a></h3>
    <p>
        Developer On Fire is a podcast showcasing interesting guests in the software industry. The focus of the podcast is how these professionals deliver value to their clients. Last episode, that interesting guest was our very own Alex Papadimoulis, CEO and founder of Inedo. Host Dave Rael picks a new guest each week, each representing different roles, countries, or technologies. It’s a great listen, and one that gives some genuine insights into...

    <h3>#7 <a href="/blog/inedo-at-devops-rex">Inedo at DevOps Rex</a></h3>
    <p>
        Monday, October 2nd, I spent the day at the DevOpsDays Paris conference called DevOps REX (a play on words as the event took place at the REX theater, but also was promoted as being 100% "Retour d'EXperience," or feedback-driven). All talks were conducted in French, and with close to 800 participants, it had doubled in size since last year's event. Their self-proclaimed three ambitions for this conference were...

    <h3>#6 <a href="/blog/nuget-essentials-a-free-virtual-seminar">Announcing a Free NuGet Seminar</a></h3>
    <p>
        We're excited to announce we'll be a hosting our first virtual training seminar, NuGet essentials, which will take place Wednesday, November 29th at 1 p.m. This virtual seminar will cover the history, best practices, and uses cases for NuGet, the open-source .NET package manager...

    <h3>#5 <a href="/blog/jenkins-vs-buildmaster-why-its-a-faulty-comparison">Jenkins vs. BuildMaster: Why It's a Faulty Comparison</a></h3>
    <p>
        As a vendor of an Application Release Automation solution, we get asked this question all the time: “Well, can’t I just use *insert CI tool* for my deployments?” Take for instance Jenkins, we often have evaluators compare Jenkins to BuildMaster, which is more like comparing apples to oranges. Jenkins and BuildMaster are different products, that solve different problems, and both are commonly used together as...

    <h3>#4 <a href="/blog/devopsdays-tokyo-happened-and-was-a-huge-success">DevOpsDays Tokyo 2017</a></h3>
    <p>
        DevOpsDays Tokyo 2017 took place on Tuesday, Apr 25, 2017 and was a huge success! The event went so well that we have already started thinking about next year. We were extremely excited to be involved by not only sponsoring and organizing this event, but also having Inedo's Founder and CEO, Alex Papadimoulis, speak. Alex and Tsuyoshi Ushio gave the opening keynote address to kick things off, and later Alex gave another 45 minute talk on DevOps for Japan. We enjoy seeing Inedo community members at events like this, and hearing them share their experiences in the DevOps world. We'd like to give a special shout out to...

    <h3>#3 <a href="/blog/we-were-just-reminded-why-its-so-important-to-always-have-a-private-repository">The Importance of Saving your Assets in a Private Repository</a></h3>
    <p>
        We were reminded yet again, why keeping your assets solely in the cloud isn't the best option. The Verge published an article titled: Amazon's web servers are down and it's causing trouble across the internet , and we're having flashbacks of #npmgate. In this time of outages, we would like to remind our users how important it is to have your assets in a private repository...

    <h3>#2 <a href="/blog/announcing-user-profiles---create-yours-today">Announcing User Profiles</a></h3>
    <p>
        Regardless of whether you're a ProGet, BuildMaster, or Otter user, you've probably utilized our QA forum at some point. With our product offering expanding this year, we've seen more and more folks using the QA forum. Not only to seek responses from our support engineers, but also answering other users' questions, and providing advice around troubleshooting and best practices. Noticing the camaraderie and expanded usage of the forum, we've decided to add user profiles to create a more usable and sustainable platform for you, our users...

    <h3>#1 <a href="/blog/inedo-recognized-in-the-2017-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-application-release-automation">Inedo again Recognized in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation</a></h3>
    <p>
        Inedo has been recognized by Gartner, Inc. in the 2017 Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation for its ability to execute and completeness of vision, and is listed in the Critical Capabilities for Application Release Automation Solutions report.
