  <title>Webinar Announcement: VorSecurity on the importance of tracking vulnerabilities in your Universal Package Manager</title>

    <h1 style="padding: 20px 0; text-align: center;">Tracking vulnerabilities in your Universal Package Manager</h1>

    <p>
        Integrating vulnerability scanning with your Universal Package Manager allows you to identify known security and compliance risks. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Because your Universal Package Manager is such a vital link in your DevOps Toolchain, it's important to ensure the packages
        you are using don't have any known vulnerabilities associated with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        To help our users learn more about the importance of vulnerability scanning, we're hosting a webinar with V&ouml;r Security 
        founder and CEO Ken Duck. Ken will cover just how common vulnerabilities are, how to use V&ouml;r Security and ProGet together 
        to ensure your components are free of known vulnerabilities, and how to assess them quickly when they are found.

        As npm and NuGet didn't exist before 2010, using public libraries as the building blocks of custom software has 
        become common practice in quite a short period of time. This shouldn't surprise anyone since the productivity gains of 
        using public libraries are very attractive, however, with the good, often comes the bad.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using public libraries while building custom software has always had a major downside. The possibility of potentially introducing 
        unknown vulnerable components into the end product rises, as more public packages used.

        That's why Inedo is ecstatic to be partnering with V&ouml;r Security. The Partnership between Inedo and V&ouml;r Security allows 
        ProGet users to integrate vulnerability scanning as part of their package management, ensuring that compromised components aren't 
        used in software development.
