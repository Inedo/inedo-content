  <title>Webinar Announcement: An Introduction to Infrastructure as Code with Otter</title>

    <h1 style="padding: 20px 0; text-align: center;"> An Introduction to Otter: Provision your Servers and Manage Configuration</h1>

    <p>
        <a href="/otter">Otter</a> helps you provision and configure your servers automatically, without ever needing to log-in to a command prompt. You can define reusable sets of configurations called roles, and then scale your infrastructure by simply assigning these roles to any number of servers.
    </p>
    <p>
            In this webinar, you will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Learn about core concepts in Otter</li>
        <li>

    <p>
        Manually remediating drift across a large number of servers can be a daunting and time-consuming task. Instead of 
        adding more team members when the number of servers increases, the simplest solution is to eliminate the manual 
        workload all together, by implementing automation that scales with you. 
    </p>
    <p>
            Otter continuously monitors your servers for configuration changes, and reports when there's configuration drift. You can set servers to automatically remediate drift, or schedule remediation and other configuration changes as needed.
    </p>
            <p>      
            You can manage everything from Otter's web-based dashboard, and selectively share your servers' configuration, state, and change history with other teams, without giving them control, or even requiring them to learn OtterScript.
