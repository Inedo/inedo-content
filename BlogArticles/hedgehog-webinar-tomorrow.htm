    <p>
        We created Hedgehog because of the frustrations that many of our users were encountering as they shifted to using packages for their own applications and components:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
        <li>
            <a href="/buildmaster">BuildMaster</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_release_automation" target="_blank">Application Release Automation</a> tools are too "release" focused, not centered around packages
        </li>
        <li>
            Other package-based tools get complicated at scale, and too few tool experts create a bottleneck
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Hedgehog is not only intuitive and easy to use, but has a powerful, free version that has no limit on the number of projects, users, or servers!
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/7391496994499675138" target="_blank">Join us</a> tomorrow (May 10<sup>th</sup>), at 1PM Eastern. Alex will be talking more about this, and how you can use Hedgehog to accelerate and scale your releases.

   <p>
    See you then!
