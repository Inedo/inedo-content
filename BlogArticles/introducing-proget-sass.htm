  <title>ProGet as a Service: Introducing Hosted ProGet</title>
  
</head>
<body>
    <h1 >Introducing <a href="/proget/pricing/saas-request">ProGet Hosted</a></h1>
   
    <p>
        A full-service, cloud-based solution for organizations that don't want to host ProGet on-premises.
        Benefit from all the features of ProGet Enterprise, with the convenience of a secure, dedicated instance 
        on Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.
    </p>
    <p>
        While on-premise or hosted solutions both have their benefits, organizations should assess which option
        fits their needs best.
    </p>

    <h4>
        <strong>Is ProGet Hosted right for you?</strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Here are 4 reasons ProGet Hosted might be what you're looking for.
    </p>
    <h4>
        <strong>1.</strong> Cost of Subscription
    </h4>
    <p>
        You only pay for what you need, and with our monthly, or yearly subscription options, flexibility is on your side.
        Even as you scale as an organization, you can achieve a clear idea of what your costs will be.
    </p>

    <h4>
        <strong>2.</strong> Start Using ProGet Quickly
    </h4>
    <p>
        With this subscription model, ProGet is already installed and configured. Users quickly have ProGet ready to go, 
        and without the time spent going through setup and install, users are able to rapidly begin proof-of-concept and discovery. 
    </p>

    <h4>
        <strong>3.</strong> Peace of Mind
    </h4>
    <p>
        You won't be responsible for ProGet's upgrades, uptime, or security when you choose Hosted ProGet. With the frequent upgrades to the hosted instance,
        often times more frequently and seamlessly than you would on-premise, you'll find a significant reduction in testing and time lost.
    </p>
    <h4>
        <strong>4.</strong> Accessibility
    </h4>
    <p>
        Since it is hosted in the cloud, and accessible over the internet, users can access ProGet wherever they are connected.
        For those on the road, the ability to access ProGet Hosted, packages, and feeds when needed, can change the nature of your organization.
