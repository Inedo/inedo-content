    <h1>Pipelines as Code: How you can fully embrace Agile and DevOps</h1>
    <p>
        Recently, Michiel Sens over at <a href="https://xebialabs.com/">XebiaLabs</a> published a series of blog posts titled, 
        <br/>"<a href="http://blog.xebialabs.com/2016/03/28/agile-still-really-not-agile-pipeline-automation/">
            Still Not Really Agile? What Pipeline Automation Can Do For You.
        </a>" 
    </p>
    <p>    
        It’s a fantastic three part series that focuses on examining the twelve principles of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile Manifesto</a>. 
        Michiel states that the goal of this series is to 
        "<i>
            inspire you to think about how Software Development Pipeline automation can help your company to move forward and take the next steps towards becoming a
            truly agile company. Not just a company adopting agile principles, but a company that is really positioned to respond to the ever changing environment that
            is our marketplace today
        </i>."
    </p>

	<p>
        Michiel, we completely agree! Pipelines will help companies move forward, as well as increase visibility across their applications and 
        <a href="/incremental">incrementally adopt a DevOps culture</a>. 
    </p>
	
    <p>
        Being a software company focused on making excellent DevOps tools, we will often see users looking to not only adopt tools that will help them grow within this ever changing DevOps and Agile sphere, 
        but who are also truly looking to change the culture and environment of their organization. <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/pipelines">
        Release Pipelines in BuildMaster</a> can help them do exactly that.
