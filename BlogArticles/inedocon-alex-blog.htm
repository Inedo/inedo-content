  <h1><strong>Let's Talk at InedoCon</strong></h1>
  <p>I've been getting pretty excited about InedoCon, especially after <a href="https://youtu.be/XexeyHhma_I" target="_blank">my recent interview about the conference</a>. I've also been thinking a lot about the <a href="https://confengine.com/inedocon-2019/proposal/8595/opening-remarks-choosing-correctly-in-an-adapt-or-die-world" target="_blank">keynote address</a>, and what I want to talk to you about in-person.</p>
  <h2>Software Development has Gotten Painfully Complex</h2>
  <p>Writing business software used to be a lot easier. But these days, developers are not only expected to become full-stack software engineers and master a constantly-changing set of languages and platforms, but also master cloud architecture, serverless computing, and container orchestration?</p>

  <p>It's no wonder that developers in organizations that are trying to “modernize” are struggling to write code that delivers real business value. It's just platform, plumbing, and problems.</p>

  <p>Modern software development doesn't have to be like this. I've helped a lot of our customers navigate this nonsense and let their developers get back to what they do best: writing code for the business.</p>
  <h2>Let's All Talk More, In-Person</h2>
  <p>Over the years, I've had the opportunity to meet many of you in-person, and the value of face-to-face meetings has been immeasurable. I would have never believed that, especially considering how easy email, chat, and web meetings are, but the results speak for themselves.</p>
  <p>Nearly all the major changes you've seen at Inedo are a direct result of feedback from these face-to-face meetings:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><a href="/open?utm_source=blog-article&amp;utm_medium=inline-link&amp;utm_campaign=alex-inedocon">Open sourcing our code</a></li>
      <li><a href="/support/submit-ticket">Creating a new ticketing system</a></li>
      <li><a href="/blog/i-messed-up-were-getting-back-to-builds">Returning BuildMaster back to its CI/CD roots</a></li>
      <li><a href="/support/documentation/executionengine">The Inedo Execution Engine</a></li>
      <li><a href="/otter?utm_source=blog-article&amp;utm_medium=inline-link&amp;utm_campaign=alex-inedocon">Creating Otter itself</a></li>
    </ul>
  <p>InedoCon is our chance to come together, learn from one another, and work together to make our jobs, companies, and lives better. There's a reason that world leaders hold summits, executives have retreats, and software companies have user conferences. I hope you can be part of our change too.</p>

  <h2>Why should you attend?</h2>
<p>
  Our team wrote a nice <a href="/blog/reason-14-why-you-should-attend-inedocon-2019">justification letter</a> that captures the business value of the event, and I also talked about this with our COO, Michael Goulis:

<p>
  Definitely worth mentioning the workshops though: these are our professionally-developed courses, given by our master trainers &mdash; and are designed to teach everyone (even experienced users) some valuable things. For example, I designed BuildMaster and even I learned a few things about its usage :)
