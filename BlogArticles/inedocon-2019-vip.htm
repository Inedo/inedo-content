  <h2>InedoCon 2019 Highlights</h2>
  <p>WebMD's Continuous Delivery Architect <a href="https://confengine.com/inedocon-2019/proposal/8594/the-enterprise-automation-journey" target="_blank">Aaron Jensen</a> will talk about how they successfully transitioned from a monolith application with no
    automation, to a CI/CD platform with dozens of microservices using BuildMaster.</p>
  <p><a href="https://confengine.com/user/jody-dorchester" target="_blank">Jody Dorchester</a> will present how 100's of applications were automated with BuildMaster in less than a year, while maintaining compliance in a <strong><em>Governmental Institution</em></strong>!</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.inedocon.inedo.com/certification" target="_blank">Workshops</a> where you'll learn how to use BuildMaster and ProGet tools to automate builds, create a deployment pipeline, improve vulnerability assessment and testing, and make use
    of telemetry to enable self-support and centralized alerts/diagnostics.</p>
  <p><a href="https://confengine.com/inedocon-2019/proposal/8785/using-proget-and-synchrofeed-to-drive-componentization-and-automation" target="_blank">Robert Vandehey</a>, Alkami's Vice President and Chief Architect, will show how they componentized a monolith
    into packages for microservices using ProGet as the key link in their deployment chain.</p>
