    <p>
	  The Subversion extension provides integration with Subversion
	  source control repositories.
	</p>
	<h3>Subversion Prerequisites</h3>
	<p>
	  On Windows systems, the Subversion extension will use the SharpSvn
	  client for communicating with repositories, so no additional software
	  is required. On Linux, the svn command-line client is required. Note that
	  the command-line client may also be used on Windows if configured in
	  the Subversion Provider.
	</p>
	<h3>Source Control Actions</h3>
	<p>
	  The <b>Get Latest</b> action is fully supported by the Subversion provider.
	  However, since Subversion does not have a concept of labels, the <b>Get Labeled</b>
	  and <b>Apply Label</b> actions are <i>not</i> supported.
	</p>
	<h4>Tagging in Subversion</h4>
	<p>
	  The <b>Tag</b> action can be used to tag source code in a repository
	  by copying it to another path. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  Select the path to tag in the <i>Source Path</i> field, the tag path in the
	  <i>Target Path</i> field (using the BuildMaster %RELNO% and %BLDNO% variables),
	  and optionally a comment describing the action.
	</p>
