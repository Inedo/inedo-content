        First, you need to install the OSS Index Extension by going to Administration > Extensions > OSS Index. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Note: Sonatype acquired Vor Security in 2017, read the <a href="https://www.sonatype.com/sonatype-acquires-vor-security-announces-lifecycle-xc">press release</a> for more details. In ProGet v5.0 and earlier, this extension was named Vor Security. </b> </p>
    <p> If you're new to OSS Index, you'll need to create an account and become a register user. This can be done by visiting <a href="https://ossindex.sonatype.org/" target="_blank">https://ossindex.sonatype.org/</a>, selecting the user icon in the top right corner, and <em>Register for an account</em>.</p>
    
      <p>
        Once logged into OSS Index, you can copy the API token.
      </p>
      <p>
        After retrieving the API token from OSS Index, set it as your Vulnerability Source in ProGet by going to <em>Administration</em> > <em>Manage Vulnerability Sources</em> > <em>Create Vulnerability Source</em>.
      </p>
