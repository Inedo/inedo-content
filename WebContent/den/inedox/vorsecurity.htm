    <h3>OSS Index Integration</h3>
    <p>
        The OSS Index extension provides a Vulnerability Source that will automatically import vulnerability reports from various public databases using a Sonatype OSS Index registered account.
    </p>
    <p>
        All newly imported vulnerability reports are considered unassessed, which means that packages matching the vulnerability will be blocked until the report is assessed. An assessment involves an authorized user reviewing the report, choosing an assessment type (Ignore, Caution, Block), and leaving an optional comment.
