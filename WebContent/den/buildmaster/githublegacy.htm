    <h3>Legacy GitHub Extension</h3>
    <p>
        This extension is only for compatibility with Legacy Plans, Legacy Source Control Providers, and Legacy Issue Trackers Providers created with the former GitHub Extension built prior to BuildMaster v5.6. This extension may be deleted when all provider-based actions and issue tracking providers are removed from your installation of BuildMaster.
    </p>
    <p>
        Going forward, the <a href="/den/buildmaster/github">GitHub extension</a> should be used to create GitHub-specific source control operations e.g. GitHub-GetSource.
