    <h3>Legacy Git Extension</h3>
  <p>
    This extension is only for compatibility with Legacy Plans and Legacy Source Control Providers created with the former Git extension
    prior to BuildMaster v5.6. This extension may be deleted when all provider-based actions and issue tracking providers are removed from your
    installation of BuildMaster.
  </p>
  <p>
    Going forward, the <a href="/den/buildmaster/git">Git extension</a> should be used to create Git-specific source control operations e.g. Git-GetSource.
