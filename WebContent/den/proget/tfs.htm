    <h3>Store TFS Build Artifacts in ProGet</h3>
    <p>
        Using ProGet to store TFS Build Artifacts creates a second, secure repository for proprietary assets as well as creating a canonical location for all release data. Further, using ProGet to create Release Packages enables security and compliance features such as user restrictions, feed retention, as well as the ability to create a release package from multiple build artifacts when appropriate.
