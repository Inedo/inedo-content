    <h3>Securely Store Build Artifacts</h3>
    <p>
        Utilizing a Binary Repository like ProGet adds another layer of flexibility to build processes.  Uploading Build Artifacts from Jenkins directly to ProGet enables easily available storage for valuable organizational assets, whether on a secure local server, or on a series of Cloud based nodes. This work-flow also ensures that dispersed teams have access to the same build artifacts via feed replication, and allows for multiple build artifacts, from multiple CI feeds to be used when creating a deploy package.
