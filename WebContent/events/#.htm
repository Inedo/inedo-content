                    Software packaging is immensely useful for deployment of software libraries, tooling, and more. There is a package system for almost every environment you could imagine. But how does this help you with environments that don't share a common packaging system? Our solution is to build Universal Packages that allow you to take your software wherever it is you need it to go. Watch the seminar recording to learn how.
