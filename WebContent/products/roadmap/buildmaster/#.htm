                        v5 is <b>fully supported</b>; bug fixes will continue to be shipped in the 5.8 release, and we will continue to maintain <em>earlier</em> v5 releases to resolve any critical or security issues discovered for users who cannot yet upgrade to 5.8

                        The central theme of v5 is <em>modern</em> application release automation. This means modernizing some of our approaches to problems
                        (for example, <em>pipelines as code</em>) and creating more integrations that help BuildMaster fit even nicer in enterprise DevOps toolchains.

                        The central theme of v4 was <em>usability</em>, not just in making things look nicer and be easier to use,
                        but in improving our existing features, making them more flexible, and easier to discover.

                        Although there was no central theme to BuildMaster 3.x releases, we made significant performance and
                        architectural improvements, and solidified a lot of our existing features while adding a few more.

                        The main focus for BuildMaster 2.x releases was new features. We introduced a whole lot of them, including an installer, Promotion Requirements, chained builds &amp; deployments, Change Controls, Server Groups &amp; Clustered Deployments, Triggers, the API, the the SDK, the Extension Gallery, and a free edition.

                        Long before "DevOps" and "continuous delivery" entered the general lexicon, we shipped BuildMaster 1.0.
                        It was rough around the edges yet functional. We learned that there was definitely a demand for this
                        type of product, but that it needed far more features to solve complex deployment and delivery
                        scenarios.
