            Although the 
            <a href="/release">base game of <i>Release!</i></a> is pretty fun by itself,
            we designed <i>Release!</i> with extensibility in mind. You can
            add lots of variety to <i>Release!</i> by installing different plug-ins
            and expansions into the base game.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to offering
            some pretty wild shifts to gameplay, some of these plug-ins
            and expansions will replace existing cards, while others will
            form completely new decks.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are currently a lot of plug-ins and
            expansions (a lot), so we recommend playing a few base
            games of <i>Release!</i> before trying them out.
        </p>
        <!--
		<p>
		<i>Release!</i> grew up quick on Kickstarter. We started with a fairly simple core game, one we luckily planned
		with extensibility in mind, because as our backers and sponsors flooded in we quickly found ourselves
		with something more akin to a game platform than our original design. With 15 expansions out of the gate and more rolling
		in we realized we would need a living library to house them. Our solution was the Repository. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We want to make sure you can always play any version of <i>Release!</i> of course we would love you to buy it, but we
		will always offer a free version of the game, and all expansions. Please browse here to learn a bit about each expansion, 
		our sponsors, and find links to download the free Print and Play versions of any of our cards.

            Trick-taking games revolve around counting cards and knowing what your opponents will throw before they do. That's cool, but
            sometimes you need to be more flexible than that. The Agility expansion twists your foundations by randomly adding in duplicates
            of half the core deck, so you can't tell just what's coming next and makes thinking-on-your-feet a must.

            it in the bag; there is a lot that can go wrong, and even though you get a few pretty powerful perks, you also can lose all the points you put up, and more.

            scoring mechanic to celebrates teamwork, communication, and friendly competition.

            How's your memory? This expansion will put it to the test. This 18-card expansion introduces a whole new side board mechanic 
			that offers incentives for placing cards from your hand face down in a Library.
		</p><p>
            New play cards help manipulate your library or other players' libraries so even when you are sure you know what's what, someone can swoop in and pull the rug 
			out from under you.

            This is a tricky one. This expansion introduces the logging play mechanic which lets players carry cards over from release to release. 
			A smart player can cache cards they won and set themselves up for a big round, as well as keeping a careful eye on what everyone else is 
			up to.  This small, 6 card plug-in adds some big changes.

            The Migrations deck adds a new scoring mechanic to the game.  The rules are pretty simple to grasp, but the changes to game play wind up being a lot 
					more complex than you would expect.  At the end of each round, players will migrate cards to an application portfolio, the Migrations deck scores 
            from these cards. 
					Each round those points get bigger, but as cards leave the rounds get shorter and players have to change their strategies for the holes 
					in the usual line up.

			This is another 6 card plug-in, the Modeling Deck. Each round you reveal one of these cards, the main theme of which is to pair certain rules and 
            structures from each release. 
			On one hand, this speeds up and simplifies play. On the other hand, these shifts do invariably change the game in big ways, which force you to rethink, 
            and replan what constitutes a good strategy.

            Since this was a game built by the community, this expansion celebrates six open source projects that change the way the community builds software. 
			Gameplay-wise, these projects are represented by a 6 new Tools &amp; Methods cards that add a lot of in-round scoring rules. 
            When you play with the Open Source Plug-in, how you score points matters as much as counting up the points themselves.

			Much like real-life Ops, these act as powerful trump cards. But keep in mind that you'll often you want to throw a hand rather than take it, 
			and thus you'll need to play your Ops trump cards appropriately. Also, the Operations Expansion has a whole new deck of Tools &amp; Methods cards 
			that will interact with the Ops cards to add layers of new strategy.

			and will allow you to score points for certain combos... so long as you reveal your hand to everyone at the table.

			you the chance to shift the public hands around.
