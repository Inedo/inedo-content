                        At <a href="/">Inedo</a>
                        we don’t actually make games. Usually, our days consists of building tools for Enterprise DevOps like <a href="/proget">ProGet</a>, <a href="/hedgehog">Hedgehog</a>, <a href="/otter">Otter</a>, <a href="/buildmaster">BuildMaster</a> and more!. We do love games though, and <i>Release!</i> is our own way of celebrating both.

            <h1>About Release!</h1>
            <p>
                The game is simple: manage cooperation and
                competition with other players across five releases
                to score the most points. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each round of <i>Release!</i> is
                played the same way, but the scoring rules change as
                you reveal new tools and methods. Your team needs
                to continuously respond to these strategic shifts in
                order to produce the best release possible.

                We also have a few copies of the massive, 338-card Kickstarter edition. 
                This will only be available for a short time, as <i>Release! Kickstarter Edition</i> was a limited run and supplies are limited.

		    Creating <i>Release!</i> was an amazing opportunity for us. We love games, probably to a weird degree, and making one
		    has a lot more appeal to us than selling one.  We would love it if you 
            <a href="https://release-the-game.backerkit.com/preorders">buy a copy</a>, but we wanted to make sure anyone who wanted to play could.  
		    </p>
		    <p>
            <a href="http://cdn.inedo.com/release/core.pdf">Release! Print &amp; Play</a> is our answer to that: PDFs of all of our cards available free of cost. Print them, 
		    on some card stock and cut them out, that's it. Unless you are unfamiliar with scissors this should be a snap.

            <h1>The Repository</h1>
            <p>
                Although the base game of <i>Release!</i> is pretty fun by itself,
                we designed <i>Release!</i> with extensibility in mind. You can
                add lots of variety to <i>Release!</i> by installing different plug-ins
                and expansions into the base game. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to offering
                some pretty wild shifts to gameplay, some of these plug-ins
                and expansions will replace existing cards, while others will
                form completely new decks.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are currently a lot of plug-ins and
                expansions (a lot), so we recommend playing a few base
                games of <i>Release!</i> before trying them out.
