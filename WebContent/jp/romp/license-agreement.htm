            <p>
                Following is our standard license agreement. If you would prefer additional terms or an otherwise customized license agreement, we are amicable to negotiation for sales of 50 or more licenses.
            </p>
            <div style="margin:10px 0px;border:double 1px black;padding:20px 40px;">
                <p>
                    This is a legally binding agreement and, like all contracts, you should read it carefully. Fortunately, we chose to use 220 words of plain English instead of
                    legalese for this agreement, so hopefully it won't be too painful for you.
                </p>

                    If you install or otherwise use Romp, then you agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. If you don't like the terms - or do not have the authority to accept the terms --
                    then don't install or use Romp.
                </p>
