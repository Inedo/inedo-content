            <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
            <p>
                Inedo strives to keep its communities professional, welcoming, friendly, respectful, and helpful. In much the same
                way Inedo's products and services simplify software development and delivery, we aim to provide an exemplary online
                community experience following a simple set of rules and guidelines. It is expected that each participant, whether
                Inedo staff or community member, abide by the following rules across all communities:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Be nice; treat others as you would want to be treated</li>

                <li>Attempt to keep all correspondence professional and on-topic</li>

                <li>Do not engage in any illegal activity</li>

                <li>Do not spam</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="reporting-violations">Reporting Violations</h3>

            <p>
                If any community member feels like the community guidelines have been violated (for them or anyone else), send us
                a detailed message on the <a href="/contact">contact us</a> form and an Inedo staff member will take action based on
                the severity as per the <a href="#enforcement">enforcement policies</a> below.
            </p>

            <h3 id="communities">Which communities does this affect?</h3>

            <p>The community guidelines above apply to all of the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Inedo QA Forum</li>
                <li>Inedo Den</li>
                <li>Inedo Support Ticketing System</li>
                <li>Inedo GitHub</li>
                <li>Inedo Slack Channel (<a href="#slack">more info</a>)</li>
                <li>Any interaction or communication with Inedo staff</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="enforcement">What are the enforcement policies?</h3>

            <p>
                Violation of any of these rules in any of Inedo's communities could result in any of the following actions at
                the judgment of any Inedo staff depending on the severity of the infraction:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A simple warning</li>

                <li>Deletion of offending post</li>

                <li>Account suspension and/or expulsion</li>

                <li>In extreme cases, referral to law enforcement</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="slack">Slack Channel Guidelines</h2>

            <p>
                Inedo's <a href="/support/slack">Slack channel</a> is a quick and easy way to interact with both Inedo team
                members and power users directly. Due to the nature of how convenient this medium of communication can be, the
                following rules and guidelines apply in addition to the community guidelines above:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Inedo-related posts only</strong>: even if only tangentially related, the posts must be related
                    to Inedo (or its associated technologies) in some way. Examples of unrelated but acceptable discussions include third-party tool integration or automation/DevOps in general. The Inedo Slack workspace is not meant to discuss, for example, how the Cleveland Browns will win the Super Bowl in 2019
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Use the correct channel</strong>: any product-related questions should be issues in the channel
                    scoped to the appropriate product (ProGet, BuildMaster, or Otter), more general Inedo-related questions or
                    comments should be posted in <code>#general</code>, and other product-related inquiries should use the <code>#support</code> channel
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Be patient</strong>: we will try our best to answer in a timely fashion, but it is important to
                    remember that this channel is still "community-based support". For official Enterprise support, the best option is
                    to <a href="/support/submit-ticket">submit a support ticket</a>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Avoid direct messaging</strong>: there is nothing inherently wrong with direct messaging, however it
                    limits the ability for others to view or respond to inquiries. If you must use direct messaging, seek approval from 
                    the recipient first before resorting to this option
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Do not pin messages</strong>: because all subscribers to the Inedo workspace are members, they are
                    granted the ability to "pin" messages. If a workspace admin notices someone doing this, it will likely result in
                    a ban from the channel and/or workspace as a whole
                </li>
