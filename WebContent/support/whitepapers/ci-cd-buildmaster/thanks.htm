                    <h4>We Need to Talk</h4>
                    <p>There's an epidemic of outdated, ineffective CI/CD systems managing the flow of information and ideas, and often companies don't even realize the extent of the problem.</p>
                    <p>We don't know what happens when a tree falls in the woods with nobody around to hear it, but we do know that, just because a department manager doesn't understand that there is a better way out there, that doesn't mean the better way doesn't exist.</p>
                    <p>Sub-optimal CI/CD processes could be costing you time and money.</p>

                <div class="centered">
                    <h4>Real World Impact</h4>
                    <p>If your current CI/CD process isn't improving the efficiency, effectiveness or economic performance of your organization, then what's the point?</p>
                    <p>Automation <em>can actually</em> cause more problems than it solves. Avoid the "CI/CD Calamity" and make sure your systems have real-world value.</p>
