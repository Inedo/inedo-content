                    <h4>What is BuildMaster?</h4>
                    <p>
                        BuildMaster lets you release your software reliably, to any environment, at whatever pace the business demands. Build a self-service release management platform by allowing different teams to manage their own applications and deploy to their own environments. Start simple and then scale to thousands of servers and the cloud...

                    <h4>Using Builds &amp; Artifacts</h4>
                    <p>
                        Builds use artifacts to store and deploy your application components. You can add artifacts to a build with a variety of different methods, one of which is to import from a CI server like Jenkins or TeamCity...<br />

                    <h4>Build a Repeatable Release Process</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pipelines let you build a repeatable release process by defining the servers and environments that your builds will be deployed to, as well as the manual and automatic approvals required at each stage of the process. Once a pipeline is created, you can select it when creating or editing a release...

                    <h4>What are Deployment Plans?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Deployment plans are the instructions that tell BuildMaster exactly how to deploy your build and perform any other needed tasks during a release. They are written in OtterScript, and can be developed using the drag-and-drop editor. You can easily switch back-and-forth between visual and text modes when building a plan...

                    <p>
                        A Domain-Specific Language that was designed in tandem with the execution engine to represent deployment plans. It is neither a general-purpose programming language (like Ruby), nor a general-purpose mark-up language (like YAML), it was inspired by both, and allows you to build declarative and imperative plans...
