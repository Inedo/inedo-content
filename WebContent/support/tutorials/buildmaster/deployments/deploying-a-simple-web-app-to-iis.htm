            BuildMaster helps release reliably, and in this tutorial you will learn how to deploy a simple ASP.NET web application along with its IIS configuration through a pipeline to create a repeatable release process.

        <strong>Note:</strong> In this tutorial, we will be manually uploading an artifact for <i>demonstration purposes</i>. The typical workflow is to import build artifacts directly from Jenkins, TeamCity, TFS, Visual Studio, or a drop path. Or if you're not already automating your builds, then you could use BuildMaster to retrieve code from source control, build it, and run unit tests.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;" id="create-application">Create an Application in BuildMaster</h2>    
    <p>
        Applications in BuildMaster are used to organize and better visualize your <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/pipelines">pipelines</a>, <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/release">releases</a>, and <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/deployment-plans">plans</a>. To create a new application in BuildMaster, select: <i>Applications</i> then <i>Create Application</i>, and enter <i>Accounts</i> as the name, then click <i>Create</i>.
        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Applications > Create Application</strong>
    </p>
       <h2 id="create-deployment-plan">Create a Deployment Plan</h2>
    <p>
        On the accounts overview page, we can select <i>Plans</i> from the application navigation menu:
    </p>
        <p>
            <img class="screenshot" alt="Application Navigation Menu" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/create-deploy-plan.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            On the plans page, select the <i>Deploy Accounts</i> plan that was auto-generated when the application was created, this will pop open the Plan Editor:
        </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Plan Editor" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/plan-editor.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Click the topmost red X to remove the example plan, then we will add a <i>General Block</i> by dragging &amp; dropping it from the statement library on the left:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="General Block" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/general-block.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter <i>Deploy Accounts</i> as the short description and click <i>Save</i>, then use the <i>Search Statements</i> box to find the <i>Ensure AppPool</i> operation, and drag-and-drop it into the newly added <i>General Block</i>. This will present many properties familiar to IIS administrators. Enter the following values into the property editor:
    </p>
    <div style="margin: 30px 0 45px 45px;">
        <p>
            <strong>Name:</strong> AccountsAppPool
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>.NET CLR version:</strong> v4.0
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>State:</strong> Stopped
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Property Editor" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/property-editor.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Click <i>Save</i>, and now, we will add a <i>Deploy Artifact</i> operation that will be used to deploy the Accounts.zip file we downloaded earlier. Search for <i>Artifact</i> in the Search Statements box, and drag-and-drop the operation under the <i>Ensure Application Pool</i> operation added previously. Enter <i>Accounts</i> as the artifact name, and <i>C:\Websites\Accounts</i> as the target directory:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Deploy Artifact" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/deploy-artifact.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Click <i>Save</i>, then add one more operation, the <i>Start App Pool</i> operation with <i>AccountsAppPool</i> as the application pool name.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once those 3 operations are added, the resulting plan should look like the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Resulting Plan" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/resulting-plan.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Click <i>Save Plan</i>, and we are now ready to edit the auto-generated pipeline. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="modify-pipeline">Modify the Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/pipelines">Pipelines</a> describe the set of stages that a package will traverse though, along with any other process controls such as <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/pipelines#Manual-Automatic-Approvals">approvals</a>, <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/pipelines#deployment-windows">deployment windows</a>, and more. Select <i>Pipelines</i> from the application navigation menu, and the auto-generated Accounts pipeline should be visible:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Accounts Pipeline" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/accounts-pipeline.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Click the <i>Accounts</i> pipeline, and then <i>edit</i> under Integration to edit the target:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Accounts > Edit</strong></p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Edit Pipeline" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/edit-pipeline.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        This will open the <i>Edit Pipeline Stage Target</i> window where we can set the server to <i>Specific servers</i>... and <i>localhost</i> as the target server:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Pipeline Target" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/pipeline-target.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Click <i>Save</i>, then select the <i>Releases</i> option in the application navigation menu, followed by <i>Create Release</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Save > Releases > Create Release</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Create Release" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/create-release.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        In the create release pop-up, we will leave the defaults, and click <i>Create Release</i>, taking us to the overview page for the 0.0.0 release. From here, we can click the <i>Create Package</i> button, making sure to <strong>uncheck</strong> <i>Automatically deploy to Integration stage</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Create Package" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/create-package.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Click <i>Create Package</i> when that field is unchecked.
    </p>
    <h2 id="upload-artifact">Upload Artifact</h2>
    <p>
        With our release package created, we can associate the artifact with it. Select <i>manual upload</i> from the Artifacts section, name it <i>Accounts</i>, and browse to the Accounts.zip file we download as a prerequisite.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Manual Upload" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/manual-upload.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Once uploaded, we can click <i>deploy</i> on the Integration stage, followed by the <i>Deploy Package</i> button:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>deploy > Deploy Package</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Deploy Package" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/deploy-package.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
        Once <i>Deploy Package</i> is clicked, the live execution page shows the execution of the steps that were added to the deployment plan:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Live Execution" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/live-execution.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        We will see that the deployment has completed and progressed to the first stage in the pipeline:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" alt="Stage One" src="/resources/tutorials/bm-deploy-web-app-v6/stage-one.png" />
    </p>
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
        In summary, with just a few simple operations in BuildMaster, we have laid the groundwork for a repeatable release process.
