        <p>
            It is common to show users of a web site when the site was last published, typically by incrementing a build/revision number, or displaying a "last published" date. There are a variety of ways this can be achieved: from manually updating the date on the web server to reading from external data storage such as a file or database to display the value. With BuildMaster, it can be integrated as part of the build and deploy process.

      Let's say our website has one extremely simple page:
   </p>
   <p>
      <pre class="tutorial-code">
   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
   &lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Simple Website&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
     Version: [[unpublished]]
   &lt;/body&gt;
   &lt;/html&gt;</pre></p>
   <p>
      On a local workstation, the page outputs exactly what you would expect:
   </p>
   <p class="console">
      Version: [[unpublished]]
   </p>
    <h2 id="step-one">Step 1: Specify server context</h2>
    <p>
        Use a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/execution-engine/statements-and-blocks/general-blocks">General block</a> to set server context this allows you to specify server(s) that will be searched.
    </p>
    <h2 id="step-two">Step 2: Add an Action</h2>
   <p>
      Now assuming we have an application with a release created in BuildMaster, we just need to add an action that manipulates the file (or files if necessary) to replace any <strong>[[unpublished]]</strong> placeholders with the actual BuildMaster release &amp; build number.
   </p>
   <p>
      We can do this with the <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/operations/files/search/replace-file-contents"><i>Search/Replace File Contents</i></a> operation. When executed, this operation will replace all instances of the specified text with a designated value.
   </p>
    <p> In this case, use a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/functions">built-in BuildMaster</a> variable combination of <strong>$ReleaseNumber.$ReleasePackageNumber</strong>. When it comes time for deployment, this variable combination will be replaced with the BuildMaster release number, a literal period, then the current package number. The  <strong>**.html</strong> means that all files and subfiles that are .html will be searched.
   </p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="/resources/tutorials/version-number/whole-plan2.png" />
    
   
   <p>
      In my demonstration plan, I copy the files to the BuildMaster default directory, run the replacement, then copy the replaced file to an "output" directory on my machine.
   </p>
    <h2 id="step-three">Step 3: Execute a Build</h2>
   <p>
      When you execute a build, the <strong>C:\Test\html\example.html</strong> file will be copied into the default directory, the <strong>[[unpublished]] </strong> text will be replaced with the current release &amp; build numbers, and the output will be copied into <strong>C:\Test\html-replaced\example.html</strong>. Here is a simple diff between the two files that were built under release 6.3, build #3:
   </p>
   <p>
      <img class="screenshot" src="/resources/tutorials/version-number/version-4.png" />
   </p>
    <h2><i>Option 2: Use a Date Instead</i></h2>
   <p>
      Use <strong>$Date("MM-dd-yyyy")</strong> (where <strong>MM-dd-yyyy</strong> is any <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/az4se3k1.aspx"> valid .NET date/time format string</a>) instead of <strong>$ReleaseNumber.$BuildNumber</strong> and create a new build:
   </p>

   </p>

      Text replacements aren't simply limited to simple date replacement; for other ways to perform replacements or even take advantage of Variable Functions, check out the documentation for BuildMaster's <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/functions">built-in variables engine</a>.
