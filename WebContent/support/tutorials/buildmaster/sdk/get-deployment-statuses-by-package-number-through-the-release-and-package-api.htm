                There are times when a third-party tool may be interested in retrieving the status of a build in BuildMaster,
                generally to be consumed by a custom tool that you have written. Starting with <a href="/buildmaster/5.0">BuildMaster v5</a>,
                the <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-package">Release &amp; Package Deployment API</a>
                offers a simpler mechanism for retrieving build statuses.

            Step 1: Create an API Key
        </h2>
        <p>
            To enable the API, you must create an API key within BuildMaster. Simply navigate to <i>"Administration" &gt; "API Keys &amp; Access Logs"</i> and
            create an API key. Make sure to enable <i>"Grant access to Release &amp; Deployment API"</i> so the key you create has access to the required API endpoint.

            Step 2: Get the Deployment Details
        </h2>
        <p>
            Once you have an API key, you can perform a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-package#get-deployments">Get Deployments</a>
            request. There are several filters you can apply. In this example, we'll apply the Application, Release, and Package filters.

            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The response will look something like this. In this case, we can see that the deployment failed!
