        <p>
            In some source control systems (SVN, CVS, etc.), a label (also known as a "tag" in SVN) is created by creating
            a fork (or branch) of the code. In others (TFS, Vault, Git, etc.), the operation is simply known as "label".

      BuildMaster makes it easy to label code during a build execution. Any <a href="/den?source-control">source control provider</a> that is configured in BuildMaster can be selected. In this case TFS.

    <p>
       To add a label add the <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/operations/source-control/apply-label"><i>Apply Label</i></a> operation to your deployment plan.

      <b>Note</b>: For Subversion users, make sure to use the <i>Tag</i> operation instead of the <i>Apply Label</i> operation.
   </p>
   <p>
      Once you have the <i>Apply Label</i> operation configured in the deployment plan, you can use the <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/operations/source-control/get-labeled"><i>Get Labeled</i></a>
      operation to get the same code that was just labeled:
