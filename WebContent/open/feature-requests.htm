          <h2>Feature Request Process</h2>
            <p>Is one of our products missing something you need? Is there a behavior <em>quirk</em> that is causing you lots of headaches? Let us know! As part of our <a href="/open">open culture</a>, we are publishing our feature request process (along with a few helpful tips).</p>
            <h3>How do I submit a feature request?</h3>
            <p>A feature request should be <a href="/support/submit-ticket">submitted as a ticket</a>. In this ticket, you should clearly describe your desired change in the software, along with a rationale for why this change is useful.</p>
            <h3>Evaluating a Feature Request</h3>
            <p>We ask all of these questions about new features. If the answer to any is "yes," then the feature request will <em>probably</em> be rejected, but of course this is more a set of guidelines than a strict ruleset.</p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Is the specification unclear? (we need to be able to understand what you are asking for)</li>
                    <li>Is the feature duplicative? (maybe we already have this feature and you aren't aware of it, or maybe we know of a simpler alternative)</li>
                    <li>Does the feature make the product harder to use, or have a nontrivial chance to introduce bugs in existing features?</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>If the answer to all of those questions is "no," then we will assess it. Assessing a feature request means having a developer very quickly establish:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the total development effort?</li>
                    <li>What is the potential risk? (which subsystems could be affected by changes in behavior?)</li>
                    <li>What is the total documentation effort?</li>
                    <li>How should this be tested?</li>
                    <li>What level of product experience is required for the development?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>When the assessment is completed, the feature may be scheduled and prioritized. Scheduling is a somewhat subjective process of translating an assessment. The following are the rough guidelines we use:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Are effort and/or risk low/trivial?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Priority can remain low, and may be scheduled for the next maintenance release</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Effort and/or risk moderate?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Priority low, scheduled for next minor release</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Effort and/or risk high?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Priority low, unscheduled
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It may be assigned to a developer to work on in a separate branch at the lowest possible priority</li>
                                    <li>If unscheduled for a long time (subjective &ndash; how long is too long?), reject request</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>We try to provide transparency to you during this process. This means that if we have classified your feature request as low-priority and unscheduled, we will try to explicitly inform you of this (and why).</p>
            <h3>Rejecting a Feature</h3>
            <p>We want people to request new features in our software. We believe this is a less intrusive and more accurate way of dealing with pain points than product telemetry. And, honestly, it's a good thing for us to have engaged users. That said, we're only human, and sometimes feature requests will be missed or forgotten. A primary goal of this formal process is to eliminate or minimize this type of "lost" ticket. Therefore, if we can't quickly assess and schedule your feature, we will simply tell you "no" right away &ndash; this is to save your time as well as ours. Of course, we don't want to be jerks about it, so we will always strive to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Include the reason for the rejection, and try to suggest a workaround or alternative</li>
                <li>Offer to add the feature to our backlog, but be very clear to you that it may never be implemented unless we hear from more users that want it</li>
                <li>Be as polite as possible about it :) We do appreciate that you are trying to help make our software better</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Need something more?</h3>
            <p>This document is meant to address relatively minor individual feature requests. If you need something more significant (something that you think might take a great deal of engineering effort, for example), you probably ought to use the <a href="/contact">contact form</a> instead and tell us about it.</p>
