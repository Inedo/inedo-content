            <h2>Contributing</h2>
            <p>
                We are happy to consider contributions in any of the following forms:
            </p>

            <h3>Bug Reports &amp; Feature Requests</h3>
            <p>
                Bug reports should be submitted to the Issues section of the project's corresponding GitHub repository if one exists, or filed as a <a href="/support/submit-ticket">support ticket</a> if there is no
                corresponding repository.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feature requests may be submitted through any available channels, including an associated GitHub Issues section if one exists, a <a href="/support/submit-ticket">support ticket</a> for 
                Enterprise customers, the <a href="/support/questions">QA forum</a>, or even the <a href="/contact">contact form</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before submitting a bug report or feature request, please perform a quick search of both the associated GitHub repository (if it exists), or the 
                <a href="https://inedo.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues">YouTrack instance</a> for non-public projects to ensure someone else hasn't already submitted the same item.
            </p>

            <h3>GitHub Pull Requests</h3>
            <p>
                We are happy to consider pull requests. We'll have more information available as we open up more of our projects.
                But for now, here's a few guidelines for what we'll consider:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Bug fixes of any kind (obviously the more trivial the code change the more likely we are to accept quickly)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Minor features or usability tweaks that have little or no impact on documentation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Must not contain large non-functional changes (i.e. please don't rewrite the entire project just because you don't like the coding style)
                </li>
                <li>
                    We'll consider refactoring changes so long as they provide some tangible benefit in maintainability, but it would be best to start a discussion with us before starting something like this
                </li>
                <li>
                    Must not add major new features, change current behaviors, or otherwise render our current documentation totally incorrect
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In terms of licensing, we obviously will not accept pull requests that violate or our own license terms, or require additional licensing 
                restrictions beyond the associated project's license agreement.
            </p>
