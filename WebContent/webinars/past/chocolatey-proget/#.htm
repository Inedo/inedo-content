                ProGet is a Universal Package Manager. It serves as an organization's central repository, providing storage for all important assets in once place. This structure is a critical stepping stone in building more reliable software and adopting DevOps best practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Packages are the center of a DevOps toolchain, and are a modern necessity to increase automation, decrease deployment cycle times, and provides insight into an organization software development. In addition to extensible universal packages, ProGet supports many external repositories including: Chocolatey, NuGet, npm, Bower, PowerShell, Docker, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using ProGet and Chocolatey together lets you host your Chocolatey packages alongside the rest of your packages.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means you can operate with a standardized process for accessing all of your packages, which is particularly relevant for quality, compliance, and security concerns across your entire development life cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>In this webinar</strong>, Rob Reynolds, of Chocolatey, reviews the benefits of both tools. He will also take you through a demo of how to use ProGet and Chocolatey in conjunction, for a complete Windows package management solution.
