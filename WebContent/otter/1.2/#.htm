    <h1><img src="/resources/images/logos/otter-logo.png" alt="Otter" /> 1.2 has arrived!</h1>
    <p class="info">
        <b>Note:</b> This is not the latest version of Otter.
    </p>

        <p>
            Otter maintains your servers' configuration using an <em>infrastructure as code</em> approach, 
            and with Otter 1.2, you now have the ability to
            import and export Otter's very own <em>configuration as code</em>. This makes sharing and maintaining your infrastructure configuration that much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're upgrading, make sure to check out <a href="/support/kb/1124">Upgrade Notes for Otter 1.2</a>.

        <h3>Import and Export Configuration</h3>
        <p>
            You can export all of your instance's infrastructure configuration
            (<a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/servers">servers</a>,
            <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/environments">environments</a>, and
            <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/server-roles">server roles</a>)
            as a JSON file.
        </p>
        <p><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/export-config.png" alt="export configuration" /></p>
        <p>
            You can also import a configuration file as well; this allows you to quickly configure or make massive changes to Otter's infrastructure configuration.
            And with the "dry run" option, you can see the changes that <em>would be made</em> before actively making the changes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="release-feature">
        <h3>Configuration Synchronization</h3>
        <p>
            It's quite common to Otter for managing server configuration, and <a href="/buildmaster">BuildMaster</a> for application release automation; because
            they both use the same set of servers, you can synchronize the infrastructure between multiple instances.
        </p>
        <p><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/sync-settings.png" alt="Synchronization Settings" /></p>
        <p>
            When you enable infrastructure synchronization, your Otter instance connects to either a BuildMaster or Otter instance, pulls configuration from that instance,
            and updates the infrastructure configuration as needed.
        </p>
    </div>   
    <div class="release-feature">
        <h3>Infrastructure Management API &amp; API Keys</h3>
        <p>
            The Infrastructure Management API Endpoints offer a simple mechanism for querying, creating, and updating
            <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/servers">server</a>, <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/environments">environment</a>, and
            <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/server-roles">server role</a> entries; they are intended to automate the set-up and
            management of an Otter instance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, you can now create specific API Keys which can control which functionality a may be used by which integration is given the key.
