                <h1>Roadmap: where Otter has been, and where we see it going.</h1>
                <p>
                    Otter is by no means "feature complete", and although the software works great for our users today, we're actively working on making it even better. This roadmap page is a bit rough, but it should show you which changes we plan on making in releases to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decide on what changes to make to Otter based on a number of factors, the largest of which is <em>user feature requests</em>. If there's anything you think Otter should do &#8212; or should do <em>better</em> &#8212; please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and let us know.
                </p>

                <h2><img src="/otter/roadmap/2.png" alt="" />Version 2</h2>
                <p>
                    The central theme of v2 is <em>provisioning your servers and managing configuration</em>, this means you can manage them automatically, without ever needing to log-in to a command prompt. You can define reusable sets of configuration called roles, and then scale your infrastructure by simply assigning these roles to any number of servers.
                </p>

                        The central theme of v1 is <em>disruption</em>. Otter v1 will make your Windows servers a first-class DevOps citizen, and bring visibility of server configuration to everyone in your IT organization, not just those fluent in proprietary, Ruby-based DSLs.
