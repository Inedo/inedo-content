        <p class="info">
            <b>Note:</b> This is not the latest version of Otter.

        <h3>We've officially launched Otter 1.0!</h3>
	<p>
        Thanks to everyone who provided feedback in the design and beta cycles.
	</p>
        <p>
            With your help, we built an Infrastructure as Code product that's really easy to use and allows everyone 
            to understand how your servers are configured, and how you orchestrate infrastructure deployments.
        </p>
	<p>
        If you're currently using (or have tried to use) other Infrastructure as Code tools, such as <a href="/support/kb/1109">Puppet</a>
         or <a href="/support/kb/1110">Chef</a>-- great! Every tool has its benefits, and you can <a href="/otter/tutorial">easily use Otter alongside them</a>, 
        as many of our early adopters are currently doing.

<p>Otter provides a different layer of visibility for your entire IT operation, and we're hearing a lot of feedback from our first users that the visual, 
            drag-and-drop interface and native Microsoft Windows support have been game-changers for them. Here's a quick preview of the editor, 
            showing how easy it is to go from Visual mode to Text mode:</p>
