            SureID remediates server drift with the click of a button
        </h2>
        <h4>
            As a top-to-bottom "Windows shop", SureID hosted the majority of their infrastructure on Windows servers. 
            After realizing their build engineer was spending far too much time manually remediating server drift, 
            they decided they needed to make a change. Needing Windows support, looking for a tool that was designed for Windows was step number one.
