            Otter maintains your servers' configuration using an <em>Infrastructure as Code</em> approach.

        <h3>Agentless Servers for Windows</h3>        
        <p>
            Although the <em>Inedo Agent</em> is highly-optimized, lightweight, and <a href="/support/documentation/otter/installation/agent-installation-guide">quite easy to install</a>, sometimes an
            agentless approach is preferred. This is where <em>Agentless Windows Servers</em> come in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just enable PowerShell Remoting (see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849694.aspx" target="_blank">Enable-PSRemoting</a>), and
            Otter will now be able to communicate with Windows servers that don't have the Inedo Agent installed!
        </p>
        <p>
            See <a href="/support/documentation/otter/administration/agents">Managing Agents and Servers</a> for more information.

        <h3>Variables Enhancement</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="/support/documentation/otter/global-components/configuration-variables">Configuration Variables</a> got some exiting improvements in this release:
        </p>
        <ul class="normal">
            <li><b>Sensitive Configuration Variables</b> - casually obscure viewing of sensitive variables, for things that don't quite need the security of a resource credential</li>
            <li><b>Variable Editing</b> - improved configuration variable editor to allow for map types</li>
            <li><b>Variables as JSON</b> - switch back-and-forth between text- and visual mode when editing variables</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="release-feature">
        <h3>Execution Engine / OtterScript Enhancements</h3>
        <p>
            We added a couple interesting features to the Execution Engine: global variables (for sharing across asynchronously executing blocks) and locking (to ensure critical sections run exclusively, and not in parallel).
            Tutorials are coming soon, but in the mean time, check out the <a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/otter-script/formal-grammar">formal grammar</a> and  <a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/otter-script/formal-specification">formal specification</a>
            for how they work.

    <div class="release-feature">
        <h3>New API Endpoints</h3>
        <p>
            To help you automate and configure Otter, we added two new API endpoints you can use to programmatically query or configure Otter instances.
        </p>
        <ul class="normal">
            <li><a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/api/configuration-management">Config Management API</a> - query, check, and remediate configuration drift with a simplified API endpoint</li>
            <li><a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/api/variables">Variables Management API</a> - update configuration variables with a simplified API endpoint</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="release-feature">
        <h3>Get started!</h3>
        <p>
            You can <a href="/otter/download">download</a> Otter and take your own test drive, and see for yourself just how easy visualizing your infrastructure can be.
            If you have a feature you'd like to add, don't hesitate to contact us via the <a href="/support/questions">support Q&amp;A</a> forum.
