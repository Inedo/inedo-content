        <p>
            Otter maintains your servers' configuration using an <em>Infrastructure as Code</em> approach, and with Otter 1.5 even more functionality is added with support for indexers and new extensions.

        <h3>List and Map Indexers</h3>        
        <p>
            We updated the execution engine to support <em>indexers</em> for list and map variable types. 
            This greatly simplifies the use of complex expressions, allowing you to do things like:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>@MyList(3)</li>
            <li>%SysConfig.Drives.Mounts</li>
            <li>set %Customers[$index] = %Templates[customers-$index];</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="release-feature">
        <h3> New Extensions - JIRA and git <!-- and TFS--></h3>        
        <p>
            We've added more extensibility by allowing you to hook in with other tools in your DevOps toolchain. Otter now has a first-class integration with <a href="/den/otter/jira">JIRA</a> and <a href="/den/otter/git">git</a>. Through the extensions, you're now able to use built-in operations from within your <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/plans">configuration and orchestration plans</a>.
