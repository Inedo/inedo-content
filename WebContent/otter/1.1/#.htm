            As the adorable illustration implies, Otter 1.1 introduces support for Linux/SSH-based servers and Git-based configuration storage and
            rafts! If you're upgrading, make sure to check out <a href="/support/kb/1121">Upgrade Notes for Otter 1.1</a>.

        <h3>Linux Servers / Agent-less Communication</h3>
        <p>
            To communicate with Linux servers, Otter uses the lightweight, highly-optimized, and resilient protocol already
            enabled on nearly every Linux box: SSH and SFTP. You can connect with a private key or username &amp; password

        <h3>Git-based Configuration &amp; / Rafts</h3>
        <p>
            Although <a href="/support/documentation/otter/global-components/rafts">rafts</a> are an advanced feature, they are an integral part of how Otter works.
            The good news is, even if you don't need to use multiple rafts, you can simply replacing the built-in raft with a <a href="/support/tutorials/storing-otter-plans-and-configurations-in-git">Git-based raft</a>, and now all of your configuration plans,
            orchestration plans, and assets will be versioned!
