            ProGet is a Universal Package Manager that lets you host and manage not only your in-house packages, but also an ever growing list of 
            external repositories including PowerShell, Bower, RubyGems, NuGet, Npm, and many more!
            It was designed from the ground-up to be fast and easy to use, for both personal, and enterprise use.

        <h3>Introducing Vulnerability Scanning</h3>
        <p>
            ProGet Enterprise, Basic, and Load-Balanced now support Vulnerability scanning. ProGet integrates with third-party providers,
            that scans data, and flag packages with known vulnerabilities. We are shipping with Vor Security as a built-in source, with
            more sources coming soon.

        <p>
            Using ProGet along side a vulnerability provider gives you the ability to set user privileges, enforcing who is allowed to assess the 
            vulnerabilities severity, and what action those assessments will entail. Keep in mind, just because there is a vulnerability associated with a package, 
            doesn't automatically mean it will impact your feed as a whole. You may choose to ignore,
            block the package from being downloaded, or proceed with caution, as well as any assessment types you choose to set yourself. For an
            in-depth explanation, check out the <a href="/support/tutorials/proget/configuring-a-vulnerability-source">Configuring a Vulnerability Source</a> tutorial.
