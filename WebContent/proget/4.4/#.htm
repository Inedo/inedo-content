            ProGet is a Universal Package Manager that lets you host, and manage, not only your in-house packages, but also an ever growing list of external repositories including NuGet, npm, Bower, Maven, and <a href="/ps">PowerShell</a>.
            It was designed from the ground-up to be fast and easy to use, for both personal, and enterprise use.

     <p>
         This feature allows you to view additional information about where the packages are deployed, who deployed them, and what application was used for the deployment.
