            ProGet is a universal package manager that lets you host and manger your in-house packages and a growing list of external repositories including NuGet, npm, Bower and Maven. 
            It was designed from the ground-up to be fast and easy to use, for both personal and enterprise use, and includes a source and symbol server to make debugging NuGet Packages a breeze. 
        </p>
        <p>
