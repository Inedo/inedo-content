            <h1>Roadmap: where ProGet has been, and where we see it going.</h1>
            <p>
                ProGet is by no means "feature complete", and although the software works great for our users today, we're actively working on making it even better. This roadmap page is a bit rough, but it should show you which changes we plan on making in releases to come.
            </p>
            <p>
                We decide on what changes to make to ProGet based on a number of factors, the largest of which is <i>user feature requests</i>. If there's anything you think ProGet should do &#8212; or should do <em>better</em> &#8212; please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and let us know.
            </p>

            <p>
                The central theme of v5 is <em>packaging your applications and components</em>, so that you can ensure your software is built only once, and then deployed consistently across environments. This means not only hosting your developer libraries (such as NuGet, npm, etc.), but your <a href="/support/documentation/proget/docker/private-registries">Docker containers</a>, <a href="/support/documentation/proget/core-concepts/packages#universal-package">universal packages</a>, and <a href="/support/documentation/romp/romp-packages/layout">romp packages</a> as well.
            </p>

                    <b>Virtual connectors</b>; these will allow you to connect one feed to another feed on the same instance of ProGet without using the UI; this will vastly speed up queries.

                    The central theme of v4 was all about <i>universal package management</i>, which meant managing all of the various types of packages and feeds in the enterprise.

                    The central theme of v3 was to extend the reach of package serving to other registries/repositories including npm.

                <p class="info">
                    v3 is <b>semi-retired</b>, which means that we will provide very limited support to v3 users who have not yet upgraded, and will provide assistance in performing upgrades. However, we will no longer ship maintenance releases, patches, or other changes.

                <p>
                    The central theme of v2 was to introduced more filtering options (particularly for license types), and added meta-features such as the SDK, the API, and source code licensing.

                        The initial release of ProGet provided basic NuGet feed support while introducing features such as connectors, filtering, multiple feeds, along with an integrated symbol &amp; source server for NuGet packages.
