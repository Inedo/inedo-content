            ProGet is a Universal Package Manager that lets you host and manage not only your in-house packages, but also an ever growing list of external repositories (now including PowerShell!).
            It was designed from the ground-up to be fast and easy to use, for both personal and enterprise use.

        <h3>Introducing Multi-site Replication</h3>
        <p>
            ProGet Enterprise users now have the ability to mirror feeds across multiple ProGet servers, both locally and globally.
            Implementing the multi-site replication requires specific feed configurations; one feed must be configured as <i>allow other feeds 
            to replicate with</i> and one or more feeds configured to <i>replicate from external feed</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This allows for a lot of different configurations, including synchronizing multiple ProGet servers across the globe.
        </p>
        <div>
            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/resources/documentation/proget/administration/basic-feed-rep.png" /></p>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this example, Los Angeles is configured to allow other feed to replicate with it, while Cleveland, and Tokyo
            are configured to replicate from external feeds.
