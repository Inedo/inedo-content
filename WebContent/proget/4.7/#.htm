            ProGet is a Universal Package Manager that lets you host and manage not only your in-house packages, but also an ever growing list of 
            external repositories including PowerShell, Bower, RubyGems, NuGet, Docker, and many more!
            It was designed from the ground-up to be fast and easy to use, for both personal, and enterprise use.

        <h3>Introducing License Filtering</h3>
        <p>
            ProGet Enterprise, Basic, and Load-Balanced now support License Filtering. License filtering is important for compliance, 
            and allows organizations to block the download of unacceptable licenses. Thus protecting personnel from 
            developing with unapproved licenses, and violating copy rights, rights of use, or conditions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            License filtering is also especially useful for organizations whose separately functioning business units both use 
            the same instance of ProGet, with separate feeds, but one has more stringent licensing guidelines.
        </p>
        <img src="/proget/4.7/proget-license-filtering.png" />
      <p>
          License Filtering works by comparing a table of known licenses, against the license field of a package's metadata, and if a 
          user has permission, they can choose to either allow or block the download. 
      </p>
