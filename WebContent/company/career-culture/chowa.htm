                Many companies use a “command-driven” structure of organization, where all orders and decisions always come from the highest levels. We aren’t “many companies.”

                Inedo is an international organization that focuses on planning and execution to ensure predictable results and relies on the accountability of every employee for success. At Inedo, we embrace a different set of values that we know help our employees—and ultimately Inedo—be both more independent and more successful.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Keikaku</strong> represents how we organize the work we do, as individuals, on teams, or as a whole company. Keikaku (pronounced kayee-kah-koo and written 計画) roughly translates as “planning.” The character 計 means not only “to plan” but also “to measure.” The 画 character is more abstract, referring to a picture (not a photograph).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We give others a picture of our planning process and how we measure project progress through Keikaku.

                      <strong>Renraku</strong> guides how we interact with each other in a standardized manner despite many different personality types and communication styles. Renraku (pronounced ren-rah-koo and written as 連絡) almost directly translates to “contact,” “communication,” “inform,” “message,” etc. Renraku indicates a transmission of information (as opposed to an explanation/teaching of something or telling a story). The character 連 generally means “to lead along” or “join/connect,” and the 絡 character indicates entanglement, involvement, or relationship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Renraku represents our commitment to clear, precise communication.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Kyoryoku</strong> is how we measure employee growth and success at Inedo. Kyoryoku (pronounced kyo-ryo-ku and written as 協力) roughly translates to collaboration or cooperation. The character 協 represents working together (like the “co-” prefix in English), and 力 represents strength.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                      Kyoryoku represents our commitment to the idea that we are stronger when we work together, rather than depending on micromanagement.

                <li><strong>Seiko</strong> (成功, “success”) – “not succeeding” does not mean failing; one must take risks to grow</li>
