            <h4>
                Many companies use a “command-driven” structure of organization, where all orders and decisions always come from the highest levels. We aren’t “many companies.”
            </h4>
            <h4>
               Inedo is an international organization that focuses on planning and execution to ensure predictable results and relies on the accountability of every employee for success. At Inedo, we embrace a different set of values that we know help our employees—and ultimately Inedo—be both more independent and more successful.
             </h4>
             <ul class="chowa">
               <li>We first and foremost <em><strong>reject micromanagement.</strong></em> </li>
               <li>To do this, we instead <em><strong>embrace a culture of ownership and responsibility</strong></em> for each employee. </li>
               <li>Delegation can be scary, so we define clear roles and responsibilities not only for each position at the company but also for each role within projects. </li>
               <li>This culture is impossible without <em><strong>clear communication and focus on the “greater context.”</strong></em> </li>
               <li>All these elements together, combined with <em><strong>strategic planning</strong></em> of projects and initiatives at all levels of the company allow Inedo to continue providing value to our users and to maintain a pleasant and productive work environment for employees.</li>
             </ul>
             <h4>
               In his time working alongside Kenji Hiranabe (one of the founders of Agile), CEO Alex Papadimoulis learned the value of face-to-face meetings and of written planning and strategy. He also learned, however, that over-planning can create a difficult work culture. Alex and COO Mike emulated our multinational identity and proudly knitted West to East by articulating our values as “Chowa” or being “in harmony.”
             </h4>
             <p class="callout">
              <strong>Chowa (pronounced cho-wah and written 調和 ) roughly translates to “harmony.” The 調 character refers to tone or tune, and the 和 character indicates “blending.” Chowa is not about a utopian state of “harmony” at Inedo (that isn’t realistic). The “harmony” of Chowa speaks to our attempts to bring employees from all over the world into sync through common practices and values.</strong>
            </p>

             <h4>Chowa represents our lightweight operations guide that provides a common system of accountability, language, and way of working.</h4>
             <h3>Keikaku</h3>
             <h4>
               <strong>Keikaku</strong> represents how we organize the work we do, as individuals, on teams, or as a whole company. Keikaku (pronounced kayee-kah-koo and written 計画) roughly translates as “planning.” The character 計 means not only “to plan” but also “to measure.” The 画 character is more abstract, referring to a picture (not a photograph). We give others a picture of our planning process and how we measure project progress through Keikaku.
             </h4>
             <h3>Renraku</h3>
             <h4>
               <strong>Renraku</strong> guides how we interact with each other in a standardized manner despite many different personality types and communication styles. Renraku (pronounced ren-rah-koo and written as 連絡) almost directly translates to “contact,” “communication,” “inform,” “message,” etc. Renraku indicates a transmission of information (as opposed to an explanation/teaching of something or telling a story). The character 連 generally means “to lead along” or “join/connect,” and the 絡 character indicates entanglement, involvement, or relationship. Renraku represents our commitment to clear, precise communication.
             </h4>
            <h3>Kyoryoku</h3>
            <h4>
              <strong>Kyoryoku</strong> is how we measure employee growth and success at Inedo. Kyoryoku (pronounced kyo-ryo-ku and written as 協力) roughly translates to collaboration or cooperation. The character 協 represents working together (like the “co-” prefix in English), and 力 represents strength. In short, Kyoryoku represents our commitment to the idea that we are stronger when we work together. This is why we use an employee-driven “Personal Development Plan” system, instead of superior-driven micromanaging.
            </h4>
            <h4>Other Values, or Shinnen (信念,“values”) include:</h4>
            <ul class="chowa">
              <li>Seiko (成功, “success”) – “not succeeding” does not mean failing; one must take risks to grow</li>
              <li>Taikyoku (大局, “seeing the bigger picture”) – having adequate context empowers individual decision-making</li>
              <li>Kaizen (改善, “continuous improvement”) – Toyota’s admirable term for always working to be better</li>
              <li>Anzen (安全, “psychological safety”) – fostering a work environment where no one fears innovation or risk-taking</li>
              <li>Shintaku (信託, “trust”) – avoiding micromanagement is only possible through delegation and trust in one another</li>
              <li>Andon (行灯) – referring to the Andon cord in Japanese manufacturing, this means “pulling the cord” or raising issues loudly and often when they come up and block improvement</li>
            </ul>
