        While you wait for a response, be sure to check out a few things that make Inedo a cool place to work. We have an extensive in-house
        <a href="/company/scotch-menu">scotch library</a> that we consistently add to and update. We also have some <a href="/company/cool-stuff">fun side projects</a> 
        that keep our creativity flowing, and our minds fresh!

        Also, it should go without saying, but we highly recommend you familiarize yourself with the tools we make, and the tenants behind our design process, we're probably going to ask.
