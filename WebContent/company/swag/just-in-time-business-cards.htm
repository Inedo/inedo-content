        <h1>JIT BizCards</h1>

        <p>
            You find yourself in the middle of a vendor hall, with booths as far as your eyes can see. There are tchotchkes of all shapes, colors, and sizes that are practically begging to find a home in your cubicle.
            As you ogle all the goodies, your fellow conference-goers swarm the room and start snagging the niftiest of toys. But fear not: you've got your swag bag and are ready to collect your loot.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Now imagine the horror</em> as you reach into your pocket for the de-facto convention currency - the business card - only to find that you are fresh out. As you fumble to find an alternative,
            your colleagues hand out their cards and quickly clear-out the collectables. You're left with mere scraps and gather little more than a few pens and pads of paper.
        </p>
        <h4>Just-In-Time Business Cards</h4>
        <p>
            Never attend a conference without <i>Just-In-Time Business Cards</i>. The back features
            Initech (&#224; la <i>Office Space</i>) while the front offers a convenient means of conveying
            your vital information.
