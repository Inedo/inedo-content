        <h1>Inedo's Sweet Sweet Swag</h1>

        <h2>Inedo Conference Swag</h2>

        
        <p>
            The conference, it is here that the consummate professional learns the tricks of the trade, gains
            insight into increased productivity, and networks a web of connections that will propel him to new
            heights. Yet what is the true goal of any veteran conference-er, the highest achievement that can
            be gained by the journeying professional?
        </p>
        <p>
            Why free stuff of course! Precious, precious, swag. Brilliant, and mildly useless trophies to adorn
            the shelves of cubicles and offices for years to come. Delightful ornaments emblazoned with
            peeling corporate logos that are the envy of less traveled workmates.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have yet to visit us at a conference, fret not: our swag may still be available, and we'll gladly
            mail it to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've only got two oldies but goodies in our conference swag portfolio as of now, <a href="/company/swag/just-in-time-business-cards">Just in Time Business Cards</a>,
            and <a href="/company/swag/codemash-2010-the-game">CodeMashup: The Game</a>.
            Check them out
        </p>
        <p>
            We also provide some editions of <a href="/release">Release! the Game</a> for conferences as well.

        <h4>Inedo Pens</h4>
        <p>
            We decided to get a bunch of pens made with our logo on them because we thought the pens were cool. We were right! These pens have a fun little light on them,
            and a squishy bit you can use as a stylus - which is great for some creative doodling on your phone or tablet. 
            The most important part, the actual pen, glides like a dream across paper. You're sure to love it! <!--All you have to do is <a href="/company/swag/form">fill out the form,</a>
            and we'll send you a pen! <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> if you want more than one.-->

        <h4>Inedo Hats</h4>
        <p>
            As everyone is aware - <em>Winter is Coming,</em> and man does it get cold here in Cleveland! 
            If you're also feeling the cold winter chill, and you're in the market for a new hat, we've got a hat for you!
            It's a simple, but classic, black hat that is sure to keep your ears warm on even the coldest winter day.
            <!--To cover those frozen ears, just <a href="/company/swag/form">fill out the form,</a> and a hat will be on its way! 
            <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> if you're interested in a few.-->
        </p>

        
         <!--<h2>Stickers</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone loves stickers! So lucky for you we decided to get a whole slew of stickers printed out that are just waiting to be sent somewhere.
                Fill out this <a href="/proget/free-stickers">sticker form</a> to recieve a pack of all the stickers we've printed in the last year. This includes ProGet, Inedo, Release, and maybe a few surprises!
