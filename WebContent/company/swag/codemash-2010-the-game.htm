        <h1>CodeMash The Game</h1>
        <p>
            In <em>CodeMash 2010: The Game</em> you navigate the twisting labyrinth of the vendor's hall to assemble the finest sets of Swag this side of the Atlantic.
            Play alone or compete with up to 4 players in this fast paced game of memory and skill. Remember: at the conference your only ally is your mind.

            Unfortunately, this game's production was limited to the CodeMash conference and will likely never be
            produced again.

            However, we are quite fond of creating games when we can, and we have long since
            added the <a href="/release">Release!</a> card game to our repertoire if that is something that interests you.
