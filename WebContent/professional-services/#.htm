                DevOps is more than just implementing the latest and greatest tool. Furthermore, no consulting organization will be able to "convert" you to DevOps as that change -and the desire for it- must come from within. However, Inedo's professional services team can play a key role in helping create a plan for this internal change, get key teams and personnel in place, and ready for organizational transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                We work with organizations to establish a new mindset, grow culture, and adopt tools to facilitate automation. Our many years of experience in helping organizations successfully implement lasting solutions, provides a keen understanding of the complexities and critical importance of Enterprise DevOps acceleration. While your organization needs to be the motivation behind these changes, we're the trusted advisors and accountability partners that provide you advice and support at every step of the way.
