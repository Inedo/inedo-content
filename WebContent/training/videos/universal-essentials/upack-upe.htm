          </h3>
          <p>For the last video of this series, what I want to talk to you about is the Universal Package Explorer. This lets you have a GUI look at your packages.</p>

          <div class="image-set solo">
             <img src="/resources/documentation/upack/upe/create-new-package.png" />
          </div>

          <p>So, if you don't want to use the command-line, and you want to build something with a GUI, that's what the Universal Package Explorer is for.</p>
          <p>You can <a href="/upack/download" target="_blank">download</a> this, again for free, off the Inedo website.</p>

          <p>I'm going to show you... I have it installed somewhere... program files... there it is, the Universal Package Explorer. There are a couple of places that we can open packages from. I can open a local package. I can connect my feed, or I could create a new package. If I was going to create a new package, this is click and drag to add content. I can update all the metadata here as well.</p>
          <div class="image-set solo">
             <img src="/resources/documentation/upack/upe/add-files.png" />
          </div>
          <p>I am going to open the demo I was just working on, so let's open 1.0.1. This might take a moment, but it shows me my metadata in the package and I can update it here if I want to. There's also all the files associated with the package contents. So I can look at this, I can remove files, I can change the name of files, and I can add new files.</p>


          <p>So, everything that I could technically do... well, not everything, but most of the stuff I could do from command-line, I could also do from the Universal Package Explorer. </p>
