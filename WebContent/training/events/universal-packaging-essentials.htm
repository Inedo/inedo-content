            </p>
            <p>
                There will also be a guided lab, where you can get some hands-on experience with Universal Packages.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Software packaging is immensely useful for deployment of software libraries, tooling, and more.  There is a package system for almost every environment you could imagine.  But how does this help you with environments that don't share a common packaging system?  Our solution is to build Universal Packages that allow you to take your software wherever it is you need it to go.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because this is a lunch &amp; learn, there will be a few facilitated group discussions that we'll encourage each joining team to hold. Of course, if you plan on joining without your team, that's okay too --- you can just listen and chat with the in-person folks in Cleveland.
            </p>

             <h3>Audience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lab Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                Attendees should be comfortable with simple scripting and using a command-line interface.  While programming knowledge is not required, it would be beneficial towards understanding some of the topics.
            </p>
             <p>
                 Attendees who wish to code along with the labs should have a Windows-based PC and access to the command-line or PowerShell.  Administrative rights are also helpful, since we'll guide students through the setup of the UPack packaging system.
             </p>
