        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Otter Integration</h3>
        <img src="/buildmaster/5.5/buildmaster-otter-link.png" />
        <p>
            To help strengthen the link between your applications and infrastructure configuration, we've included three new integration points
            into Otter.
        </p>
        <ul class="normal">
            <li><b>Set Variable Value Operation</b> - Creates or assigns a configuration variable in Otter, such as a release number of a required package, a last deployed date, or a required application</li>
            <li><b>Remediate Drift Operation</b> - Checks configuration status and if drifted, triggers a remediation job in Otter. </li>
            <li><b>Drift Status Gate</b> - Verifies that a specified Otter server or role is in a specified drift status prior to deployment.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="release-feature">
        <h3>Pipeline Variables and Bulk-edits</h3>
        <p>
            You can now specify variables in a pipeline and a pipeline stage. This allows for improved reusability of deployment plans.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, you can bulk-edit sets of configuration as JSON. <!-- screenshot would be nice -->
        </p>
    </div>
    <!--
        Editor improvements - how you can now target roles more easily?
