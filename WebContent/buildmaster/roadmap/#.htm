            <h1>Roadmap: where BuildMaster has been, and where we see it going.</h1>
            <p>
                BuildMaster is by no means "feature complete", and although the software works great for our users today, we're actively working on making it even better. This roadmap page is a bit rough, but it should show you which changes we plan on making in releases to come.
            </p>
            <p>
                We decide on what changes to make to BuildMaster based on a number of factors, the largest of which is <em>user feature requests</em>. If there's anything you think BuildMaster should do &#8212; or should do <em>better</em> &#8212; please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and let us know.
            </p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2><img src="/buildmaster/roadmap/6.png" alt="" />Version 6</h2>
            <p>
                The central theme of v6 is <em>stability</em>. Despite the major version number change, BuildMaster v6 will be a relatively minor release and represents a very minimal upgrade risk. In fact, we anticipate all the upcoming releases within the v6 line to be similar.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we realize that software innovation and change is crucial &#8212; not only for us as a product company, but for our customers who want to introduce major changes in their DevOps processes - we've learned it's better to introduce these breaking changes through new products that can be installed side-by-side, as opposed to in-place upgrades.
            </p>
            <!--<p>
                In addition to bug fixes directly in the product, many stability improvements will come through shared code across products. BuildMaster's most critical components &#8212; execution engine, agents, infrastructure &#8212; are already shared components, and we will continue to componentize less-crucial features like <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/global-components/resource-credentials">resource credentials</a> and <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/administration/security">users and security</a>.

                    The central theme of v5 is <em>modern</em> application release automation. This means modernizing some of our approaches to problems
                    (for example, <em>pipelines as code</em>) and creating more integrations that help BuildMaster fit even nicer in enterprise DevOps toolchains.

                    v5 is <b>fully supported</b>; bug fixes will continue to be shipped in the 5.8 release, and we will continue to maintain <em>earlier</em> v5 releases to resolve any critical or security issues discovered for users who cannot yet upgrade to 5.8

                    The central theme of v4 was <em>usability</em>, not just in making things look nicer and be easier to use,
                    but in improving our existing features, making them more flexible, and easier to discover.

                    Although there was no central theme to BuildMaster 3.x releases, we made significant performance and
                    architectural improvements, and solidified a lot of our existing features while adding a few more.

                <p>
                    The main focus for BuildMaster 2.x releases was new features. We introduced a whole lot of them, including an installer, Promotion Requirements, chained builds &amp; deployments, Change Controls, Server Groups &amp; Clustered Deployments, Triggers, the API, the the SDK, the Extension Gallery, and a free edition.

                    Long before "DevOps" and "continuous delivery" entered the general lexicon, we shipped BuildMaster 1.0.
                    It was rough around the edges yet functional. We learned that there was definitely a demand for this
                    type of product, but that it needed far more features to solve complex deployment and delivery
                    scenarios.
