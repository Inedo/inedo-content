            <a href="/buildmaster">BuildMaster</a> is an Application Release Automation tool built for DevOps. You can create complex release pipelines all managed from one central dashboard.
            BuildMaster 5.2 is all about sharing, maintaining, and managing the common components between instances and tools and utilizes <em>Pipelines as Code</em>.

        <h3>Import and Export Configuration</h3>
        <p>
            You can export all of your instance's infrastructure configuration
            (<a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/administration/agents">servers</a>,
            <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/environments">environments</a>, and
            <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/administration/agents">server roles</a>)
            as a JSON file.
        </p>
        <p><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/export-config.png" alt="export configuration" /></p>

        <p style="clear:both">
            You can also import a configuration file as well; this allows you to quickly configure or make massive changes to Otter's infrastructure configuration.
            And with the "dry run" option, you can see the changes that <em>would be made</em> before actively making the changes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="release-feature">
        <h3>Configuration Synchronization</h3>
        <p>
            It's quite common to <a href="/otter">Otter</a> for managing server configuration, and BuildMaster for application release automation; because
            they both use the same set of servers, you can synchronize the infrastructure between multiple instances.
        </p>
        <p><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster/sync.png" alt="Synchronization Settings" /></p>
        <p style="clear:both">
            When you enable infrastructure synchronization, your instance connects to either a BuildMaster or Otter instance, pulls configuration from that instance,
            and updates the infrastructure configuration as needed.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="release-feature">
        <h3>API Keys</h3>
        <p>
            The Infrastructure Management API Endpoints offer a simple mechanism for querying, creating, and updating
            <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/administration/agents">server</a>, <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/environments">environment</a>, and
            <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/administration/agents">server role</a> entries; they are intended to automate the set-up and
            management of an Otter instance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, you can now create specific API Keys which can control which functionality a may be used by which integration is given the key.
