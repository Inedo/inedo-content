                        CI/CD is <em>supposed</em> to make our lives easier. It is <em>supposed</em> to save us time, manpower and money. It is <em>supposed</em> to boost efficiency and improve productivity. When implemented and utilized correctly, CI/CD can do all that and more&hellip; but when outdated or poorly designed, it does the exact opposite.
