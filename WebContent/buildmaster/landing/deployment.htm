                    Manual deployments take a lot of effort, time, and are error-ridden: you might forget a necessary file. But you probably already know this; in fact, you have probably already considering <a href="/buildmaster/featuresutm_source=Adwords&amp;utm_medium=Deployment" target="_blank">adding automation to your process</a>, but decided against it. <br /><br />Maybe it was because you didn't know where to start, or didn't feel you could spend the time needed to implement a new process. But adding automation shouldn't mean completely starting over.
