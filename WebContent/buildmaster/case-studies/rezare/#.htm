            <h1>Rezare enjoys exponential growth in automation with BuildMaster; invigorates their clients.</h1>

            </p>
            <p style="background-color: #0057a3;" class="overview">
                As of July 2016, Rezare has been using BuildMaster for close to 3 years. With this level of experience with BuildMaster they've not only been 
                able to solve their original challenge, but with the aid of the software delivery processes, and ecosystem they've created along the way, moved 
                on to solving new challenges and making unpredicted process improvements.
            </p>
            <h4>
                The Challenge:
            </h4>
            <p>
                For years, Rezare Systems, like most software organizations coming of age in this era, had to manually deploy their software. This involved 
                copy/pasting files, resolving dependencies, manually database management, etc.  It was unruly, error-prone, and frustrating.  During this era 
                they had attempted to use Visual Studio's "one click publish" but unfortunately it did not work at all, and broke everything it touched. From there, 
                the Rezare team looked into popular tools including Team City, Jenkins, and BuildMaster for a solution. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While TeamCity and Jenkins seemed like they would take far longer to integrate, learn, and accomplish what was needed, BuildMaster proved to be the 
                easiest to use and best-suited for that particular task. Investing in licenses was an easy decision.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Solution:
            </h4>
            <p>
                The growth-path for use of BuildMaster/BuildMaster integration should be interesting to a new BuildMaster user, and familiar to an experienced user: 
                The recommended "pilot" run with their newly purchased licenses ran about 6 months and involved 2 applications, expanded to 5 by the end of the 
                first year...and with the tracks laid out mushroomed to 126 between years 1 and 3.  Each application, of course, is different with its own requirements. 
                Rezare has automated the delivery of all of its applications this way.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "The benefit aside from the development aspect of automation, was for customers" according to Daniel Buchanan, developer. "They had confidence that 
                when we said we were going to release a build for them, that it wasn't going to break, we knew exactly what was going to happen, and if something failed, 
                we knew exactly what failed and how to fix it. All of this lead to greater increase in confidence, which then lead to deciding that we can release to 
                production far more often and thus, more innovation is occurring." 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Results:
            </h4>
            <p>
                After achieving their primary goal, Rezare has been able to enjoy another key benefits from using BuildMaster: package management integration with NuGet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Use of BuildMaster has further empowered Rezare have their our own NuGet repository with 20-25 NuGet packages built and deployed using BuildMaster. 
                After making changes to a project and its library, releasing it as a package, and eventually to production, this makes for an easy method of exposing 
                libraries to clients. Clients benefit from the fact that it is easy for them to consume these packages, getting the newest version through NuGet in 
                a similar fashion to how they receive other updates, despite Rezare maintaining the packages and keeping them up to date for clients.  
                It's an added convenience as a service provider, and clients have responded very positively to it, especially overseas clients. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the key benefit of using BuildMaster is simply confidence:  confidence to edit, update, build, and deploy far more easily and securely.
