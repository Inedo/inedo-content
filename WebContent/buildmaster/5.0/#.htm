        <h3>Introducing Pipelines as Code</h3>

        <p>
            In Version 5.0, we introduce the concept of "Pipelines as Code" giving users the ability to create and edit pipelines either visually in the UI or via the JSON editor.
            Adding another layer visibility and making simple or complex changes effortless while maintaining consistency across every release.
