        <h3>New Agents for Windows:<br /> More Reliability &amp; Otter-Compatible</h3>
        <p>
            This release introduces the <a href="/support/kb/1039">Inedo Agent</a>, which is the next generation of agent that's available to use side-by-side with the current agents.
            These agents use the same communication channel as <a href="/otter">Otter</a>, which means you only need to install one agent to work with multiple products. The new agents
            also offer more reliability with poor and interfrastic connections, especially with regards to self-upgrading the agents.

        <h3>Resource Credentials</h3>
        <p>
            The added benefit of resource credentials will simplify connections to external tools and provide greater secret storages. 
            You can now manage, store, and control access to tokens, passwords, API keys, or any other secrets that are needed for automating deployments.
