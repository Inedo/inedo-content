        <h3>Issue Tracking Integration</h3>
        <p>
            BuildMaster now has a first-class integration with a variety of Issue Trackers. Combining your issue tracking with BuildMaster allows for 
            increased visibility across your application development process. It provides insight into Testing, QA, Bug status, etc. and allows issues 
            to be transitioned with automation removing unnecessary manual steps.

        <p>
            Issue tracking sources are added by installing the
            extension for the issue tracker, and adding an Issue tracking source and corresponding resource credential in your instance.

        <h3>Improved Source Control</h3>
        <p>
            Deprecating the "provider model" in favor of using Resource Credentials and Global Variables for configuration,
            as well as tool-specific Operations. So instead of "Get-Latest using SVN" it would be "SVN-Checkout".
