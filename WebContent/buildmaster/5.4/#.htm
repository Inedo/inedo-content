            BuildMaster is an Application Release Automation tool built for DevOps.

        <h3>Agentless Servers for Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Although the <em>Inedo Agent</em> is highly-optimized, lightweight, and <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/installation/agent-installation-guide">quite easy to install</a>, sometimes an
            agentless approach is preferred. This is where <em>Agentless Windows Servers</em> come in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just enable PowerShell Remoting (see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849694.aspx" target="_blank">Enable-PSRemoting</a>), and
            Buildmaster will now be able to communicate with Windows servers that don't have the Inedo Agent installed!
        </p>
        <p>
            See <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/administration/agents">Managing Agents and Servers</a> for more information.

        <h3>Execution Engine / OtterScript Enhancements</h3>
        <p>
            We added a couple interesting features to the Execution Engine: global variables (for sharing across asynchronously executing blocks) and locking (to ensure critical sections run exclusively, and not in parallel).
            Tutorials are coming soon, but in the mean time, check out the <a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/otter-script/formal-grammar">formal grammar</a> and  <a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/otter-script/formal-specification">formal specification</a>
            for how they work.

        <h3>New API Endpoints</h3>
        <p>
            To help you automate and configure BuildMaster, we added a new API endpoints you can use to programmatically query or configure BuildMaster instances.
        </p>
        <ul class="normal">
            <li><a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api/variables">Variables Management API</a> - update configuration variables with a simplified API endpoint</li>
