            <p>
                Collaboration and automation must be done in lockstep; automation facilitates collaboration, and collaboration fosters understanding, both allowing for better automation. It is a virtuous cycle.

<h3> DevOps: For the Enterprise, <em>not just Unicorns</em></h3>
<p>
    The assumptions surrounding DevOps can sometimes be misleading, understandable so, as the term was initially popularized by companies like Etsy, Netflix, and Facebook: DevOps Unicorns. However, simply because your company doesn't fit into this category, doesn't mean you can't benefit from DevOps. In fact, DevOps Expert <a href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim">Gene Kim</a> advocates that, "The majority of value for DevOps will be created in large, complex organizations".    
</p>

          
            <!--<p class="user-quote">
                <i>
                    "If your organization runs tight on resources, and you don't have build managers, database admins, or managers responsible for separate environments, such as test, QA, production, you're going to have developers that have to push out to the environments themselves and all sorts of change process errors can occur; code that hasn't been vetted for vulnerabilities, skipped steps, etc.  It can really turn into a compliance nightmare quickly.  BuildMaster has helped us scale and avoid these compliance issues."
