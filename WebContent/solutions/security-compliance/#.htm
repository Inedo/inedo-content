                From Sarbanes-Oxley to HIPAA, compliance frameworks and mandates impact nearly every enterprise. At the same time, IT organizations within these enterprises are increasingly asked to produce and implement changes that will deliver and meet business needs faster than ever. This brings new challenges of implementing a flexible and responsive development process, while still complying with these regulations.

            <p>
                The <a href="/products">Inedo toolchain</a> not only considers compliance standards, but defines trackable, secure steps that become a part of your entire software development process.

                    “If your organization runs tight on resources, and you don’t have build managers, database admins, or managers responsible for separate environments, such as test, QA, production, you’re going to have developers that have to push out to the environments themselves and all sorts of change process errors can occur; code that hasn’t been vetted for vulnerabilities, skipped steps, etc.  It can really turn into a compliance nightmare quickly.  Inedo has helped us scale and avoid these compliance issues.”
