            <h3>Support and Maintenance</h3>
            <p>
                Hedgehog licenses included access to our support engineers through <a href="/support/submit-ticket">tickets</a> and our <a href="/support/questions">QA Forum</a>. In addition to Hedgehog technical support, we can provide help debugging automation challenges and offer generalized DevOps advice from our years of experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Support for previous versions and upgrades to newer versions are also included.
            </p>


            <h3>Licensing Terms</h3>
            <p>
                Hedgehog is licensed annually per the <a href="/hedgehog/license-agreement">Hedgehog End-User Licensing Agreement</a> on a per-user basis; this license includes support and maintenance.
            </p>
            <h4><i>Users in Hedgehog</i></h4>
            <p>
                Hedgehog is designed to be used by the entire development organization: developers, testers, operations, management, etc. While not all members will need the same access, Hedgehog's granular security options may limit which groups and individuals can access which functions in which applications in which environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any number of users may be given access to Hedgehog, and are automatically assigned an available user license the first time they log in. Administrators may manually de-license a user to free up available licenses if that user is no longer on the team.
            </p>

            <h4 id="perpetual"><i>Perpetual Licensing Available</i></h4>
            <p>
                Hedgehog may also be licensed on a perpetual, non-expiring basis. Support, upgrades, and maintenance are included for the first year, and may be renewed each following year for 20% of the then-current licensing fees. You may pre-purchase up to three years of support.
            </p>
            <p>
                The perpetual licensing fees are: 10 Users ($7,495); 20 Users (11,245); 35 Users ($18,745); 50 Users ($24,375); 100 Users ($37,495); 250 Users ($74,995). Assuming support is renewed, the break-even point of Annual vs. Perpetual licensing comes after four years.
            </p>
